n8n public REST API#
Feature availability
The n8n API isn't available during the free trial. Please upgrade to access this feature.
Using n8n's public API, you can programmatically perform many of the same tasks as you can in the GUI. This section introduces n8n's REST API, including:
How to authenticate
Paginating results
Using the built-in API playground (self-hosted n8n only)
Endpoint reference
n8n provides an n8n API node to access the API in your workflows.
Learn about REST APIs#
The API documentation assumes you are familiar with REST APIs. If you're not, these resources may be helpful:
KnowledgeOwl's guide to working with APIs: a basic introduction, including examples of how to call REST APIs.
IBM Cloud Learn Hub - What is an Application Programming Interface (API): this gives a general, but technical, introduction to APIs.
IBM Cloud Learn Hub - What is a REST API?: more detailed information about REST APIs.
MDN web docs - An overview of HTTP: REST APIs work over HTTP and use HTTP verbs, or methods, to specify the action to perform.
Use the API playground (self-hosted n8n only)
Trying out the API in the playground can help you understand how APIs work. If you're worried about changing live data, consider setting up a test workflow, or test n8n instance, to explore safely.
API authentication#
n8n uses API keys to authenticate API calls.
Feature availability
The n8n API isn't available during the free trial. Please upgrade to access this feature.
API Scopes#
Users of enterprise instances can limit which resources and actions a key can access with scopes. API key scopes allow you specify the exact level of access a key needs for its intended purpose.
Non-enterprise API keys have full access to all the account's resources and capabilities.
Create an API key#
Log in to n8n.
Go to Settings > n8n API.
Select Create an API key.
Choose a Label and set an Expiration time for the key.
If on an enterprise plan, choose the Scopes to give the key.
Copy My API Key and use this key to authenticate your calls.
Call the API using your key#
Send the API key in your API call as a header named X-N8N-API-KEY.
For example, say you want to get all active workflows. Your curl request will look like this:
1
 2
 3
 4
 5
 6
 7
 8
 9
10
11
# For a self-hosted n8n instance
curl -X 'GET' \
  '<N8N_HOST>:<N8N_PORT>/<N8N_PATH>/api/v<version-number>/workflows?active=true' \
  -H 'accept: application/json' \
  -H 'X-N8N-API-KEY: <your-api-key>'

# For n8n Cloud
curl -X 'GET' \
  '<your-cloud-instance>/api/v<version-number>/workflows?active=true' \
  -H 'accept: application/json' \
  -H 'X-N8N-API-KEY: <your-api-key>'



Delete an API key#
Log in to n8n.
Go to Settings > n8n API.
Select Delete next to the key you want to delete.
Confirm the delete by selecting Delete Forever.
API pagination#
The default page size is 100 results. You can change the page size limit. The maximum permitted size is 250.
When a response contains more than one page, it includes a cursor, which you can use to request the next pages.
For example, say you want to get all active workflows, 150 at a time.
Get the first page:
1
 2
 3
 4
 5
 6
 7
 8
 9
10
11
# For a self-hosted n8n instance
curl -X 'GET' \
  '<N8N_HOST>:<N8N_PORT>/<N8N_PATH>/api/v<version-number>/workflows?active=true&limit=150' \
  -H 'accept: application/json' \
  -H 'X-N8N-API-KEY: <your-api-key>'

# For n8n Cloud
curl -X 'GET' \
  '<your-cloud-instance>/api/v<version-number>/workflows?active=true&limit=150' \
  -H 'accept: application/json' \
  -H 'X-N8N-API-KEY: <your-api-key>'



The response is in JSON format, and includes a nextCursor value. This is an example response.
1
2
3
4
5
6
7
8
9
{
  "data": [
    // The response contains an object for each workflow
    {
      // Workflow data
    }
  ],
  "nextCursor": "MTIzZTQ1NjctZTg5Yi0xMmQzLWE0NTYtNDI2NjE0MTc0MDA"
}

# For a self-hosted n8n instance
curl -X 'GET' \

  -H 'accept: application/json'

# For n8n Cloud
curl -X 'GET' \
  '<your-cloud-instance>/api/v<version-number>/workflows?active=true&limit=150&cursor=MTIzZTQ1NjctZTg5Yi0xMmQzLWE0NTYtNDI2NjE0MTc0MDA' \
  -H 'accept: application/json'

Using the API playground#
Feature availability
The API playground isn't available on Cloud. It's available for all self-hosted pricing tiers.
The n8n API comes with a built-in Swagger UI playground in self-hosted versions. This provides interactive documentation, where you can try out requests. The path to access the playground depends on your hosting.
n8n constructs the path from values set in your environment variables:
1
N8N_HOST:N8N_PORT/N8N_PATH/api/v<api-version-number>/docs



The API version number is 1. There may be multiple versions available in the future.
Real data
If you select Authorize and enter your API key in the API playground, you have access to your live data. This is useful for trying out requests. Be aware you can change or delete real data.
The API includes built-in documentation about credential formats. This is available using the credentials endpoint:
1
N8N_HOST:N8N_PORT/N8N_PATH/api/v<api-version-number>/credentials/schema/{credentialTypeName}



How to find credentialTypeName
To find the type, download your workflow as JSON and examine it. For example, for a Google Drive node the {credentialTypeName} is googleDriveOAuth2Api:
1
2
3
4
5
6
7
8
9
{
    ...,
    "credentials": {
        "googleDriveOAuth2Api": {
        "id": "9",
        "name": "Google Drive"
        }
    }
}

Node types#
This feature uses Cluster nodes: groups of root and sub nodes that work together.
Cluster nodes are node groups that work together to provide functionality in an n8n workflow. Instead of using a single node, you use a root node and one or more sub-nodes that extend the functionality of the node.

Workflow templates#
You can browse workflow templates in-app or on the n8n website Workflows page.
Refer to Templates for information on accessing templates in-app.
Chat trigger#
Use the n8n Chat Trigger to trigger a workflow based on chat interactions.
Chatbot widget#
n8n provides a chatbot widget that you can use as a frontend for AI-powered chat workflows. Refer to the @n8n/chat npm page for usage information.
Build an AI chat agent with n8n#
Welcome to the introductory tutorial for building AI workflows with n8n. Whether you have used n8n before, or this is your first time, we will show you how the building blocks of AI workflows fit together and construct a working AI-powered chat agent which you can easily customize for your own purposes.

Many people find it easier to take in new information in video format. This tutorial is based on one of n8n's popular videos, linked below. Watch the video or read the steps here, or both!
What you will need#
n8n: For this tutorial we recommend using the n8n cloud service - there is a free trial for new users! For a self hosted service, refer to the installation pages.
Credentials for a chat model: This tutorial uses OpenAI, but you can easily use DeepSeek, Google Gemini, Groq, Azure, and others (see the sub-nodes documentation for more).

AI concepts in n8n#
If you're already familiar with AI, feel free to skip this section. This is a basic introduction to AI concepts and how they can be used in n8n workflows.
An AI agent builds on Large Language Models (LLMs), which generate text based on input by predicting the next word. While LLMs only process input to produce output, AI agents add goal-oriented functionality. They can use tools, process their outputs, and make decisions to complete tasks and solve problems.
In n8n, the AI agent is represented as a node with some extra connections.

By incorporating the AI agent as a node, n8n can combine AI-driven steps with traditional programming for efficient, real-world workflows. For instance, simpler tasks, like validating an email address, do not require AI, whereas a complex tasks, like processing the content of an email or dealing with multimodal inputs (e.g., images, audio), are excellent uses of an AI agent.
1. Create a new workflow#
When you open n8n, you'll see either:
An empty workflow: if you have no workflows and you're logging in for the first time. Use this workflow.
The Workflows list on the Overview page. Select the  button to create a new workflow.
2. Add a trigger node#
Every workflow needs somewhere to start. In n8n these are called 'trigger nodes'. For this workflow, we want to start with a chat node.
Select Add first step or press Tab to open the node menu.
Search for Chat Trigger. n8n shows a list of nodes that match the search.
Select Chat Trigger to add the node to the canvas. n8n opens the node.
Close the node details view (Select Back to canvas) to return to the canvas.
More about the Chat Trigger node...

View workflow file
3. Add an AI Agent Node#
The AI Agent node is the core of adding AI to your workflows.
Select the Add node  connector on the trigger node to bring up the node search.
Start typing "AI" and choose the AI agent node to add it.
The editing view of the AI agent will now be displayed.
There are some fields which can be changed. As we're using the Chat Trigger node, the default setting for the source and specification of the prompt don't need to be changed.
Click to explore
View workflow file
4. Configure the node#
AI agents require a chat model to be attached to process the incoming prompts.
Add a chat model by clicking the plus  button underneath the Chat Model connection on the AI Agent node (it's the first connection along the bottom of the node).
The search dialog will appear, filtered on 'Language Models'. These are the models with built-in support in n8n. For this tutorial we will use OpenAI Chat Model.
Selecting the OpenAI Chat model from the list will attach it to the AI Agent node and open the node editor. One of the parameters which can be changed is the 'Model'. Note that for the basic OpenAI accounts, only the 'gpt-4o-mini' model is allowed.
Which chat model?
5. Add credentials (if needed)#
In order for n8n to communicate with the chat model, it will need some credentials (login data giving it access to an account on a different online service). If you already have credentials set up for OpenAI, these should appear by default in the credentials selector. Otherwise you can use the Credentials selector to help you add a new credential.

To add a new credential, click on the text which says 'Select credential'. An option to add a new credential will appear 
This credential just needs an API key. When adding credentials of any type, check the text to the right-hand side. In this case it has a handy link to take you straight to your OpenAI account to retrieve the API key.
The API key is just one long string. That's all you need for this particular credential. Copy it from the OpenAI website and paste it into the API key section.
Keeping your credentials safe
6. Test the node#
Now that the node is connected to the Chat Trigger and a chat model, we can test this part of the workflow.
Click on the 'Chat' button near the bottom of the canvas. This opens up a local chat window on the left and the AI agent logs on the right.
Type in a message and press Enter. You will now see the response from the chat model appear below your message.
The log window displays the inputs to and outputs from the AI Agent. 
Accessing the logs...

7. Changing the prompt#
The logs in the previous step reveal some extra data - the system prompt. This is the default message that the AI Agent primes the chat model with. From the log you can see this is set to "You are a helpful assistant". We can however change this prompt to alter the behavior of the chat model.
Open the AI Agent node. In the bottom of the panel is a section labeled 'Options' and a selector labeled 'Add Option'. Use this to select 'System message'
The system message is now displayed. This is the same priming prompt we noticed before in the logs. Change the prompt to something else to prime the chat model in a different way. You could try something like "You are a brilliant poet who always replies in rhyming couplets" for example.
Close the node and return to the chat window. Repeat your message and notice how the output has changed. 
8. Adding persistence#
The chat model is now giving us useful output, but there is something wrong with it which will become apparent when you try to have a conversation.
Use the chat and tell the chat model your name, for example "Hi there, my name is Nick".
Wait for the response, then type the message "What's my name?". The AI will not be able to tell you, however apologetic it may seem. The reason for this is we are not saving the context. The AI Agent has no memory. 
In order to remember what has happened in the conversation, the AI Agent needs to preserve context. We can do this by adding memory to the AI Agent node. On the canvas click on the  on the bottom of the AI Agent node labeled "Memory".
From the panel which appears, select "Simple Memory". This will use the memory from the instance running n8n, and is usually sufficient for simple usage. The default value of 5 interactions should be sufficient here, but remember where this option is if you may want to change it later.
Repeat the exercise of having a conversation above, and see that the AI Agent now remembers your name.
9. Saving the workflow#
Before we leave the workflow editor, remember to save the workflow or all your changes will be lost.
Click on the "Save" button in the top right of the editor window. Your workflow will now be saved and you can return to it later to chat again or add new features.
Congratulations!#
You have taken your first steps in building useful and effective workflows with AI. In this tutorial we have investigated the basic building blocks of an AI workflow, added an AI Agent and a chat model, and adjusted the prompt to get the kind of output we wanted. We also added memory so the chat could retain context between messages.

RAG in n8n#
What is RAG#
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is a technique that improves AI responses by combining language models with external data sources. Instead of relying solely on the model's internal training data, RAG systems retrieve relevant documents to ground responses in up-to-date, domain-specific, or proprietary knowledge. RAG workflows typically rely on vector stores to manage and search this external data efficiently.
What is a vector store?#
A vector store is a special database designed to store and search high-dimensional vectors: numerical representations of text, images, or other data. When you upload a document, the vector store splits it into chunks and converts each chunk into a vector using an embedding model.
You can query these vectors using similarity searches, which construct results based on semantic meaning, rather than keyword matches. This makes vector stores a powerful foundation for RAG and other AI systems that need to retrieve and reason over large sets of knowledge.
How to use RAG in n8n#
Start with a RAG template
👉 Try out RAG in n8n with the RAG Starter Template. The template includes two ready-made workflows: one for uploading files and one for querying them.
Inserting data into your vector store#
Before your agent can access custom knowledge, you need to upload that data to a vector store:
Add the nodes needed to fetch your source data.
Insert a Vector Store node (e.g. the Simple Vector Store) and choose the Insert Documents operation.
Select an embedding model, which converts your text into vector embeddings. Consult the FAQ for more information on choosing the right embedding model.
Add a Default Data Loader node, which splits your content into chunks. You can use the default settings or define your own chunking strategy:
Character Text Splitter: splits by character length.
Recursive Character Text Splitter: recursively splits by Markdown, HTML, code blocks or simple characters (recommended for most use cases).
Token Text Splitter: splits by token count.
(Optional) Add metadata to each chunk to enrich the context and allow better filtering later.
Querying your data#
You can query the data in two main ways: using an agent or directly through a node.
Using agents#
Add an agent to your workflow.
Add the vector store as a tool and give it a description to help the agent understand when to use it:
Set the limit to define how many chunks to return.
Enable Include Metadata to provide extra context for each chunk.
Add the same embedding model you used when inserting the data.
Pro tip
To save tokens on an expensive model, you can first use the Vector Store Question Answer tool to retrieve relevant data, and only then pass the result to the Agent. To see this in action, check out this template.
Using the node directly#
Add your vector store node to the canvas and choose the Get Many operation.
Enter a query or prompt:
Set a limit for how many chunks to return.
Enable Include Metadata if needed.
FAQs#
How do I choose the right embedding model?#
The right embedding model differs from case to case.
In general, smaller models (for example, text-embedding-ada-002) are faster and cheaper and thus ideal for short, general-purpose documents or lightweight RAG workflows. Larger models (for example, text-embedding-3-large) offer better semantic understanding. These are best for long documents, complex topics, or when accuracy is critical.
What is the best text splitting for my use case?#
This again depends a lot on your data:
Small chunks (for example, 200 to 500 tokens) are good for fine-grained retrieval.
Large chunks may carry more context but can become diluted or noisy.
Using the right overlap size is important for the AI to understand the context of the chunk. That's also why using the Markdown or Code Block splitting can often help to make chunks better.
Another good approach is to add more context to it (for example, about the document where the chunk came from). If you want you can read more about this, you can check out this great article from Anthropic.
LangChain in n8n#
n8n provides a collection of nodes that implement LangChain's functionality. The LangChain nodes are configurable, meaning you can choose your preferred agent, LLM, memory, and so on. Alongside the LangChain nodes, you can connect any n8n node as normal: this means you can integrate your LangChain logic with other data sources and services.
Learning resources: n8n's documentation for LangChain assumes you're familiar with AI and LangChain concepts. This page provides links to learning resources.
LangChain concepts and features in n8n: how n8n represents LangChain concepts and features.
LangChain concepts in n8n#
This page explains how LangChain concepts and features map to n8n nodes.
This page includes lists of the LangChain-focused nodes in n8n. You can use any n8n node in a workflow where you interact with LangChain, to link LangChain to other services. The LangChain features uses n8n's Cluster nodes.
n8n implements LangChain JS
This feature is n8n's implementation of LangChain's JavaScript framework.
Trigger nodes#
Chat Trigger
Cluster nodes#
Cluster nodes are node groups that work together to provide functionality in an n8n workflow. Instead of using a single node, you use a root node and one or more sub-nodes that extend the functionality of the node.

Root nodes#
Each cluster starts with one root node.
Chains#
A chain is a series of LLMs, and related tools, linked together to support functionality that can't be provided by a single LLM alone.
Available nodes:
Basic LLM Chain
Retrieval Q&A Chain
Summarization Chain
Sentiment Analysis
Text Classifier

Overview#
What are evaluations?#
Evaluation is a crucial technique for checking that your AI workflow is reliable. It can be the difference between a flaky proof of concept and a solid production workflow. It's important both in the building phase and after deploying to production.
The foundation of evaluation is running a test dataset through your workflow. This dataset contains multiple test cases. Each test case contains a sample input for your workflow, and often includes the expected output(s) too.
Evaluation allows you to:
Test your workflow over a range of inputs so you know how it performs on edge cases
Make changes with confidence without inadvertently making things worse elsewhere
Compare performance across different models or prompts
The following video explains what evaluations are, why they're useful, and how they work:
Why is evaluation needed?#
AI models are fundamentally different than code. Code is deterministic and you can reason about it. This is difficult to do with LLMs, since they're black boxes. Instead, you must measure LLM output by running data through them and observing the output.
You can only build confidence that your model performs reliably after you have run it over multiple inputs that accurately reflect all the edge cases that it will have to deal with in production.
Two types of evaluation#
Light evaluation (pre-deployment)#
Building a clean, comprehensive dataset is hard. In the initial building phase, it often makes sense to generate just a handful of examples. These can be enough to iterate the workflow to a releasable state (or a proof of concept). You can visually compare the results to get a sense of the workflow's quality, without setting up formal metrics.
Metric-based evaluation (post-deployment)#
Once you deploy your workflow, it's easier to build a bigger, more representative dataset from production executions. When you discover a bug, you can add the input that caused it to the dataset. When fixing the bug, it's important to run the whole dataset over the workflow again as a regression test to check that the fix hasn't inadvertently made something else worse.
Since there are too many test cases to check individually, evaluations measure the quality of the outputs using a metric, a numeric value representing a particular characteristic. This also allows you to track quality changes between runs.

Light evaluations#
Available on registered community and paid plans
Light evaluations are available to registered community users and on all paid plans.
What are light evaluations?#
When building your workflow, you often want to test it with a handful of examples to get a sense of how it performs and make improvements. At this stage of workflow development, looking over workflow outputs for each example is often enough. The benefits of setting up more formal scoring or metrics don't yet justify the effort.
Light evaluation allows you to run the examples in a test dataset through your workflow one-by-one, writing the outputs back to your dataset. You can then examine those outputs next to each other, and visually compare them to the expected outputs (if you have them).
How it works#
Requires Google Sheets
Evaluations use Google Sheets to store the test dataset. To use evaluations, you must configure a Google Sheets credential.
Light evaluations take place in the 'Editor' tab of your workflow, although you’ll find instructions on how to set it up in the 'Evaluations' tab.
Steps:
Create a dataset
Wire the dataset up to the workflow
Write workflow outputs back to dataset
Run evaluation
The following explanation will use a sample workflow that assigns a category and priority to incoming support tickets.

1. Create a dataset#
Create a Google Sheet with a handful of examples for your workflow. Your sheet should contain column(s) for:
The workflow input
(Optional) The expected or correct workflow output
The actual output
Leave the actual output column or columns blank, since you'll be filling them during the evaluation.
A sample dataset for the support ticket classification workflow.
2. Wire the dataset up to your workflow#
Insert an evaluation trigger to pull in your dataset#
Each time the evaluation trigger runs, it will output a single item representing one row of your dataset.
Clicking the 'Evaluate all' button to the left of the evaluation trigger will run your workflow multiple times in sequence, once for each row in your dataset. This is a special behavior of the evaluation trigger.
While wiring the trigger up, you often only want to run it once. You can do this by either:
Setting the trigger's 'Max rows to process' to 1
Clicking on the 'Execute node' button on the trigger (rather than the 'Evaluate all' button)
Wire the trigger up to your workflow#
You can now connect the evaluation trigger to the rest of your workflow and reference the data that it outputs. At a minimum, you need to use the dataset’s input column(s) later in the workflow.
If you have multiple triggers in your workflow you will need to merge their branches together.
The support ticket classification workflow with the evaluation trigger added in and wired up.
3. Write workflow outputs back to dataset#
To populate the output column(s) of your dataset when the evaluation runs:
Insert the 'Set outputs' action of the evaluation node
Wire it up to your workflow at a point after it has produced the outputs you're evaluating
In the node's parameters, map the workflow outputs into the correct dataset column
The support ticket classification workflow with the 'set outputs' node added in and wired up.
4. Run evaluation#
Click on the Execute workflow button to the left of the evaluation trigger. The workflow will execute multiple times, once for each row of the dataset:

Review the outputs of each execution in the Google Sheet, and examine the execution details using the workflow's 'executions' tab if you need to.
Once your dataset grows past a handful of examples, consider metric-based evaluation to get a numerical view of performance. See also tips and common issues.
Metric-based evaluations#
Available on Pro and Enterprise plans
Metric-based evaluation is available on Pro and Enterprise plans. Registered community and Starter plan users can also use it for a single workflow.
What are metric-based evaluations?#
Once your workflow is ready for deployment, you often want to test it on more examples than when you were building it.
For example, when production executions start to turn up edge cases, you want to add them to your test dataset so that you can make sure they're covered.
For large datasets like the ones built from production data, it can be hard to get a sense of performance just by eyeballing the results. Instead, you must measure performance. Metric-based evaluations can assign one or more scores to each test run, which you can compare to previous runs. Individual scores get rolled up to measure performance on the whole dataset.
This feature allows you to run evaluations that calculate metrics, track how those metrics change between runs and drill down into the reasons for those changes.
Metrics can be deterministic functions (such as the distance between two strings) or you can calculate them using AI. Metrics often involve checking how far away the output is from a reference output (also called ground truth). To do so, the dataset must contain that reference output. Some evaluations don't need this reference output though (for example, checking text for sentiment or toxicity).
How it works#
Requires Google Sheets
Evaluations use Google Sheets to store the test dataset. To use evaluations, you must configure a Google Sheets credential.
Set up light evaluation
Calculate metrics
Write metrics back to evaluation
Run evaluation and view results
1. Set up light evaluation#
Follow the setup instructions to create a dataset and wire it up to your workflow, writing outputs back to the dataset.
The following steps use the same support ticket classification workflow from the light evaluation docs:

2. Calculate metrics#
Metrics are dimensions used to score the output of your workflow. They often compare the actual workflow output with a reference output. It's common to use AI to calculate metrics, although it's sometimes possible to just use code. In n8n, metrics are always numbers.
You need to add the logic to calculate the metrics for your workflow, at a point after it has produced the outputs. You can add any reference outputs your metric uses as a column in your dataset. This makes sure they it will be available in the workflow, since they will be output by the evaluation trigger.
Examples:
Correctness: whether the output's meaning is consistent with a reference output.
Categorization: whether the output exactly matches the expected output.
Helpfulness: whether the answer addresses the question.
String similarity: how close the output is to a reference output, measured character-by-character.
Tool calling: whether the agent called the right tool.
RAG document relevance: when working with a vector database, whether the documents retrieved are relevant to the question.
RAG answer groundedness: when working with a vector database, whether the answer is "grounded" in the documents retrieved.
Calculating metrics can add latency and cost, so you may only want to do it when running an evaluation and avoid it when making a production execution. You can do this by putting the metric logic after a 'check if evaluating' operation.

3. Write metrics back to evaluation#
n8n needs to know how to extract the metrics you calculated in step 2. Do this by adding an evaluation node with the 'Set metrics' operation and mapping your metrics into it.

This support ticket classification workflow shows the 'Set outputs' operation added and wired up. Since the metrics in this workflow just check whether the actual output is an exact match of the expected one, the workflow calculates them in an expression in the 'Set metrics' node rather than adding any further nodes to the workflow.
4. Run evaluation and view results#
Switch to the Evaluations tab on your workflow and click the Run evaluation button. An evaluation will start. Once the evaluation has finished, it will display a summary score for each metric.
You can see the results for each test case by clicking on the test run row. Clicking on an individual test case will open the execution that produced it (in a new tab).
Tips and common issues#
Combining multiple triggers#
If you have another trigger in the workflow already, you have two potential starting points: that trigger and the evaluation trigger. To make sure your workflow works as expected no matter which trigger executes, you will need to merge these branches together.
Logic to merge two trigger branches together so that they have the same data format and can be referenced from a single node.
To do so:
Get the data format of the other trigger:
Execute the other trigger.
Open it and navigate to the JSON view of its output pane.
Click the copy button on the right.
Re-shape the evaluation trigger data to match:
Insert an Edit Fields (Set) node after the evaluation trigger and connect them together.
Change its mode to JSON.
Paste your data into the 'JSON' field, removing the [ and ] on the first and last lines.
Switch the field type to Expression.
Map in the data from the trigger by dragging it from the input pane.
For strings, make sure to replace the entire value (including the quotes) and add .toJsonString() to the end of the expression.
Merge the branches using a 'No-op' node: Insert a No-op node and wire both the other trigger and the Set node up to it. The 'No-op' node just outputs whatever input it receives.
Reference the 'No-op' node outputs in the rest of the workflow: Since both paths will flow through this node with the same format, you can be sure that your input data will always be there.
Avoiding evaluation breaking the chat#
n8n's internal chat reads the output data of the last executed node in the workflow. After adding an evaluation node with the 'set outputs' operation, this data may not be in the expected format, or even contain the chat response.

The solution is to add an extra branch coming out of your agent. Lower branches execute later in n8n, which means any node you attach to this branch will execute last. You can use a no-op node here since it only needs to pass the agent output through.
Accessing tool data when calculating metrics#
Sometimes you need to know what happened in executed sub-nodes of an agent, for example to check whether it executed a tool. You can't reference these nodes directly with expressions, but you can enable the Return intermediate steps option in the agent. This will add an extra output field called intermediateSteps which you can use in later nodes:

Multiple evaluations in the same workflow#
You can only have one evaluation set up per workflow. In other words, you can only have one evaluation trigger per workflow.
Even so, you can still test different parts of your workflow with different evaluations by putting those parts in sub-workflows and evaluating each sub-workflow.
Dealing with inconsistent results#
Metrics can often have noise: they may be different across evaluation runs of the exact same workflow. This is because the workflow itself may return different results, or any LLM-based metrics might have natural variation in them.
You can compensate for this by duplicating the rows of your dataset, so that each row appears more than once in the dataset. Since this means that each input will effectively be running multiple times, it will smooth out any variations.

What's a chain in AI?#
Chains bring together different components of AI to create a cohesive system. They set up a sequence of calls between the components. These components can include models and memory (though note that in n8n chains can't use memory).
Chains in n8n#
n8n provides three chain nodes:
Basic LLM Chain: use to interact with an LLM, without any additional components.
Question and Answer Chain: can connect to a vector store using a retriever, or to an n8n workflow using the Workflow Retriever node. Use this if you want to create a workflow that supports asking questions about specific documents.
Summarization Chain: takes an input and returns a summary.
There's an important difference between chains in n8n and in other tools such as LangChain: none of the chain nodes support memory. This means they can't remember previous user queries. If you use LangChain to code an AI application, you can give your application memory. In n8n, if you need your workflow to support memory, use an agent. This is essential if you want users to be able to have a natural ongoing conversation with your app.
What's an agent in AI?#
One way to think of an agent is as a chain that knows how to make decisions. Where a chain follows a predetermined sequence of calls to different AI components, an agent uses a language model to determine which actions to take.
Agents are the part of AI that act as decision-makers. They can interact with other agents and tools. When you send a query to an agent, it tries to choose the best tools to use to answer. Agents adapt to your specific queries, as well as the prompts that configure their behavior.
Agents in n8n#
n8n provides one Agent node, which can act as different types of agent depending on the settings you choose. Refer to the Agent node documentation for details on the available agent types.
When execute a workflow containing an agent, the agent runs multiple times. For example, it may do an initial setup, followed by a run to call a tool, then another run to evaluate the tool response and respond to the user.
Demonstration of key differences between agents and chains#
In this workflow you can choose whether your chat query goes to an agent or chain. It shows some of the ways that agents are more powerful than chains.

Key features#
This workflow uses:
Chat Trigger: start your workflow and respond to user chat interactions. The node provides a customizable chat interface.
Switch node: directs your query to either the agent or chain, depending on which you specify in your query. If you say "agent" it sends it to the agent. If you say "chain" it sends it to the chain.
Agent: the Agent node interacts with other components of the workflow and makes decisions about what tools to use.
Basic LLM Chain: the Basic LLM Chain node supports chatting with a connected LLM, but doesn't support memory or tools.

Green: instructions to run the workflow.
Orange: you need to change something to make the workflow work.

What's memory in AI?#
Memory is a key part of AI chat services. The memory keeps a history of previous messages, allowing for an ongoing conversation with the AI, rather than every interaction starting fresh.
AI memory in n8n#
To add memory to your AI workflow you can use either:
Simple Memory: stores a customizable length of chat history for the current session. This is the easiest to get started with.
One of the memory services that n8n provides nodes for. These include:
Motorhead
Redis Chat Memory
Postgres Chat Memory
Xata
Zep
If you need to do advanced AI memory management in your workflows, use the Chat Memory Manager node.
This node is useful when you:
Can't add a memory node directly.
Need to do more complex memory management, beyond what the memory nodes offer. For example, you can add this node to check the memory size of the Agent node's response, and reduce it if needed.
Want to inject messages to the AI that look like user messages, to give the AI more context.
What's a tool in AI?#
In AI, 'tools' has a specific meaning. Tools act like addons that your AI can use to access extra context or resources.
Here are a couple of other ways of expressing it:
Tools are interfaces that an agent can use to interact with the world (source)
We can think of these tools as being almost like functions that your AI model can call (source)
AI tools in n8n#
n8n provides tool sub-nodes that you can connect to your AI agent. As well as providing some popular tools, such as Wikipedia and SerpAPI, n8n provides three especially powerful tools:
Call n8n Workflow Tool: use this to load any n8n workflow as a tool.
Custom Code Tool: write code that your agent can run.
HTTP Request Tool: make calls to fetch a website or data from an API.

Let AI specify the tool parameters#
When configuring tools connected to the Tools Agent, many parameters can be filled in by the AI model itself. The AI model will use the context from the task and information from other connected tools to fill in the appropriate details.
There are two ways to do this, and you can switch between them.
Let the model fill in the parameter#
Each appropriate parameter field in the tool's editing dialog has an extra button at the end:

On activating this button, the AI Agent will fill in the expression for you, with no need for any further user input. The field itself is filled in with a message indicating that the parameter has been defined automatically by the model.
If you want to define the parameter yourself, click on the 'X' in this box to revert to user-defined values. Note that the 'expression' field will now contain the expression generated by this feature, though you can now edit it further to add extra details as described in the following section.
Warning
Activating this feature will overwrite any manual definition you may have already added.
Use the $fromAI() function#
The $fromAI() function uses AI to dynamically fill in parameters for tools connected to the Tools AI agent.
Only for tools
The $fromAI() function is only available for tools connected to the AI Agent node. The $fromAI() function doesn't work with the Code tool or with other non-tool cluster sub-nodes.
To use the $fromAI() function, call it with the required key parameter:
1
{{ $fromAI('email') }}



The key parameter and other arguments to the $fromAI() function aren't references to existing values. Instead, think of these arguments as hints that the AI model will use to populate the right data.
For instance, if you choose a key called email, the AI Model will look for an email address in its context, other tools, and input data. In chat workflows, it may ask the user for an email address if it can't find one elsewhere. You can optionally pass other parameters like description to give extra context to the AI model.
Parameters#
The $fromAI() function accepts the following parameters:
Parameter
Type
Required?
Description
key
string

A string representing the key or name of the argument. This must be between 1 and 64 characters in length and can only contain lowercase letters, uppercase letters, numbers, underscores, and hyphens.
description
string

A string describing the argument.
type
string

A string specifying the data type. Can be string, number, boolean, or json (defaults to string).
defaultValue
any

The default value to use for the argument.

Examples#
As an example, you could use the following $fromAI() expression to dynamically populate a field with a name:
1
$fromAI("name", "The commenter's name", "string", "Jane Doe")



If you don't need the optional parameters, you could simplify this as:
1
$fromAI("name")



To dynamically populate the number of items you have in stock, you could use a $fromAI() expression like this:
1
$fromAI("numItemsInStock", "Number of items in stock", "number", 5)



If you only want to fill in parts of a field with a dynamic value from the model, you can use it in a normal expression as well. For example, if you want the model to fill out the subject parameter for an e-mail, but always pre-fix the generated value with the string 'Generated by AI:', you could use the following expression:
1
Generated by AI: {{ $fromAI("subject") }}



Templates#
You can see the $fromAI() function in action in the following templates:

What are vector databases?#
Vector databases store information as numbers:
A vector database is a type of database that stores data as high-dimensional vectors, which are mathematical representations of features or attributes. (source)
This enables fast and accurate similarity searches. With a vector database, instead of using conventional database queries, you can search for relevant data based on semantic and contextual meaning.
A simplified example#
A vector database could store the sentence "n8n is a source-available automation tool that you can self-host", but instead of storing it as text, the vector database stores an array of dimensions (numbers between 0 and 1) that represent its features. This doesn't mean turning each letter in the sentence into a number. Instead, the vectors in the vector database describe the sentence.
Suppose that in a vector store 0.1 represents automation tool, 0.2 represents source available, and 0.3 represents can be self-hosted. You could end up with the following vectors:
Sentence
Vector (array of dimensions)
n8n is a source-available automation tool that you can self-host
[0.1, 0.2, 0.3]
Zapier is an automation tool
[0.1]
Make is an automation tool
[0.1]
Confluence is a wiki tool that you can self-host
[0.3]

This example is very simplified
In practice, vectors are far more complex. A vector can range in size from tens to thousands of dimensions. The dimensions don't have a one-to-one relationship to a single feature, so you can't translate individual dimensions directly into single concepts. This example gives an approximate mental model, not a true technical understanding.
Demonstrating the power of similarity search#
Qdrant provides vector search demos to help users understand the power of vector databases. The food discovery demo shows how a vector store can help match pictures based on visual similarities.
This demo uses data from Delivery Service. Users may like or dislike the photo of a dish, and the app will recommend more similar meals based on how they look. It's also possible to choose to view results from the restaurants within the delivery radius. (source)
For full technical details, refer to the Qdrant demo-food-discovery GitHub repository.
Embeddings, retrievers, text splitters, and document loaders#
Vector databases require other tools to function:
Document loaders and text splitters: document loaders pull in documents and data, and prepare them for embedding. Document loaders can use text splitters to break documents into chunks.
Embeddings: these are the tools that turn the data (text, images, and so on) into vectors, and back into raw data. Note that n8n only supports text embeddings.
Retrievers: retrievers fetch documents from vector databases. You need to pair them with an embedding to translate the vectors back into data.
Populate a Pinecone vector database from a website#
Use n8n to scrape a website, load the data into Pinecone, then query it using a chat workflow. This workflow uses the HTTP node to get website data, extracts the relevant content using the HTML node, then uses the Pinecone Vector Store node to send it to Pinecone.
Click to explore
View workflow file
Key features#
This workflow uses:
HTTP node: fetches website data.
HTML node: simplifies the data by extracting the main content from the page.
Pinecone Vector Store node and Embeddings OpenAI: transform the data into vectors and store it in Pinecone.
Chat Trigger and Question and Answer Chain to query the vector database.
Using the example#
To load the template into your n8n instance:
Download the workflow JSON file.
Open a new workflow in your n8n instance.
Copy in the JSON, or select Workflow menu  > Import from file....
The example workflows use Sticky Notes to guide you:
Yellow: notes and information.
Green: instructions to run the workflow.
Orange: you need to change something to make the workflow work.
Blue: draws attention to a key feature of the example.

Expressions#
Expressions are a powerful feature implemented in all n8n nodes. They allow node parameters to be set dynamically based on data from:
Previous node executions
The workflow
Your n8n environment
You can also execute JavaScript within an expression, making this a convenient and easy way to manipulate data into useful parameter values without writing extensive extra code.
n8n created and uses a templating language called Tournament, and extends it with custom methods and variables and data transformation functions. These features make it easier to perform common tasks like getting data from other nodes or accessing workflow metadata.
n8n additionally supports two libraries:
Luxon, for working with dates and time.
JMESPath, for querying JSON.
Data in n8n
When writing expressions, it's helpful to understand data structure and behavior in n8n. Refer to Data for more information on working with data in your workflows.
Writing expressions#
To use an expression to set a parameter value:
Hover over the parameter where you want to use an expression.
Select Expressions in the Fixed/Expression toggle.
Write your expression in the parameter, or select Open expression editor  to open the expressions editor. If you use the expressions editor, you can browse the available data in the Variable selector. All expressions have the format {{ your expression here }}.
Example: Get data from webhook body#
Consider the following scenario: you have a webhook trigger that receives data through the webhook body. You want to extract some of that data for use in the workflow.
Your webhook data looks similar to this:
1
 2
 3
 4
 5
 6
 7
 8
 9
10
11
12
13
14
15
[
  {
    "headers": {
      "host": "n8n.instance.address",
      ...
    },
    "params": {},
    "query": {},
    "body": {
      "name": "Jim",
      "age": 30,
      "city": "New York"
    }
  }
]



In the next node in the workflow, you want to get just the value of city. You can use the following expression:
1
{{$json.body.city}}



This expression:
Accesses the incoming JSON-formatted data using n8n's custom $json variable.
Finds the value of city (in this example, "New York"). Note that this example uses JMESPath syntax to query the JSON data. You can also write this expression as {{$json['body']['city']}}.
Example: Writing longer JavaScript#
An expression contains one line of JavaScript. This means you cannot do things like variable assignments or multiple standalone operations.
To understand the limitations of JavaScript in expressions, and start thinking about workarounds, look at the following two pieces of code. Both code examples use the Luxon date and time library to find the time between two dates in months, and encloses the code in handlebar brackets, like an expression.
However, the first example isn't a valid n8n expression:
1
 2
 3
 4
 5
 6
 7
 8
 9
10
11
// This example is split over multiple lines for readability
// It's still invalid when formatted as a single line
{{
  function example() {
    let end = DateTime.fromISO('2017-03-13');
    let start = DateTime.fromISO('2017-02-13');
    let diffInMonths = end.diff(start, 'months');
    return diffInMonths.toObject();
  }
  example();
}}



While the second example is valid:
1
{{DateTime.fromISO('2017-03-13').diff(DateTime.fromISO('2017-02-13'), 'months

Using the Code node#
Use the Code node to write custom JavaScript or Python and run it as a step in your workflow.
Coding in n8n
This page gives usage information about the Code node. For more guidance on coding in n8n, refer to the Code section. It includes:
Reference documentation on Built-in methods and variables
Guidance on Handling dates and Querying JSON
A growing collection of examples in the Cookbook
Examples and templates
For usage examples and templates to help you get started, refer to n8n's Code integrations page.
Function and Function Item nodes
The Code node replaces the Function and Function Item nodes from version 0.198.0. If you're using an older version of n8n, you can still view the Function node documentation and Function Item node documentation.
Usage#
How to use the Code node.
Choose a mode#
There are two modes:
Run Once for All Items: this is the default. When your workflow runs, the code in the code node executes once, regardless of how many input items there are.
Run Once for Each Item: choose this if you want your code to run for every input item.
JavaScript#
The Code node supports Node.js.
Supported JavaScript features#
The Code node supports:
Promises. Instead of returning the items directly, you can return a promise which resolves accordingly.
Writing to your browser console using console.log. This is useful for debugging and troubleshooting your workflows.
External libraries#
If you self-host n8n, you can import and use built-in and external npm modules in the Code node. To learn how to enable external modules, refer to the Enable modules in Code node guide.
If you use n8n Cloud, you can't import external npm modules. n8n makes two modules available for you:
crypto Node.js module
moment npm package
Built-in methods and variables#
n8n provides built-in methods and variables for working with data and accessing n8n data. Refer to Built-in methods and variables for more information.
The syntax to use the built-in methods and variables is $variableName or $methodName(). Type $ in the Code node or expressions editor to see a list of suggested methods and variables.
Keyboard shortcuts#
The Code node editing environment supports time-saving and useful keyboard shortcuts for a range of operations from autocompletion to code-folding and using multiple-cursors. A full list can be found in the list of keyboard shortcuts.
Python#
n8n added Python support in version 1.0. It doesn't include a Python executable. Instead, n8n provides Python support using Pyodide, which is a port of CPython to WebAssembly. This limits the available Python packages to the Packages included with Pyodide. n8n downloads the package automatically the first time you use it.
Slower than JavaScript
The Code node takes longer to process Python than JavaScript. This is due to the extra compilation steps.
Built-in methods and variables#
n8n provides built-in methods and variables for working with data and accessing n8n data. Refer to Built-in methods and variables for more information.
The syntax to use the built-in methods and variables is _variableName or _methodName(). Type _ in the Code node to see a list of suggested methods and variables.
Keyboard shortcuts#
The Code node editing environment supports time-saving and useful keyboard shortcuts for a range of operations from autocompletion to code-folding and using multiple-cursors. A full list can be found in the list of keyboard shortcuts.
File system and HTTP requests#
You can't access the file system or make HTTP requests. Use the following nodes instead:
Read/Write File From Disk
HTTP Request
Coding in n8n#
There are two places where you can use code in n8n: the Code node and the expressions editor. When using either area, there are some key concepts you need to know, as well as some built-in methods and variables to help with common tasks.
Key concepts#
When working with the Code node, you need to understand the following concepts:
Data structure: understand the data you receive in the Code node, and requirements for outputting data from the node.
Item linking: learn how data items work, and how to link to items from previous nodes. You need to handle item linking in your code when the number of input and output items doesn't match.
Built-in methods and variables#
n8n includes built-in methods and variables. These provide support for:
Accessing specific item data
Accessing data about workflows, executions, and your n8n environment
Convenience variables to help with data and time
Refer to Built-in methods and variables for more information.
Use AI in the Code node#

Usage limits#
During the trial phase there are no usage limits. If n8n makes the feature permanent, there may be usage limits as part of your pricing tier.
Feature limits#
The ChatGPT implementation in n8n has the following limitations:
The AI writes code that manipulates data from the n8n workflow. You can't ask it to pull in data from other sources.
The AI doesn't know your data, just the schema, so you need to tell it things like how to find the data you want to extract, or how to check for null.
Nodes before the Code node must execute and deliver data to the Code node before you run your AI query.
Doesn't work with large incoming data schemas.
May have issues if there are a lot of nodes before the code node.
Writing good prompts#
Writing good prompts increases the chance of getting useful code back.
Some general tips:
Provide examples: if possible, give a sample expected output. This helps the AI to better understand the transformation or logic you’re aiming for.
Describe the processing steps: if there are specific processing steps or logic that should apply to the data, list them in sequence. For example: "First, filter out all users under 18. Then, sort the remaining users by their last name."
Avoid ambiguities: while the AI understands various instructions, being clear and direct ensures you get the most accurate code. Instead of saying "Get the older users," you might say "Filter users who are 60 years and above."
Be clear about what you expect as the output. Do you want the data transformed, filtered, aggregated, or sorted? Provide as much detail as possible.
And some n8n-specific guidance:
Think about the input data: make sure ChatGPT knows which pieces of the data you want to access, and what the incoming data represents. You may need to tell ChatGPT about the availability of n8n's built-in methods and variables.
Declare interactions between nodes: if your logic involves data from multiple nodes, specify how they should interact. "Merge the output of 'Node A' with 'Node B' based on the 'userID' property". if you prefer data to come from certain nodes or to ignore others, be clear: "Only consider data from the 'Purchases' node and ignore the 'Refunds' node."
Ensure the output is compatible with n8n. Refer to Data structure for more information on the data structure n8n requires.
Example prompts#
These examples show a range of possible prompts and tasks.
Example 1: Find a piece of data inside a second dataset#
To try the example yourself, download the example workflow and import it into n8n.
In the third Code node, enter this prompt:
The slack data contains only one item. The input data represents all Notion users. Sometimes the person property that holds the email can be null. I want to find the notionId of the Slack user and return it.

const notionUser = notionUsers.find(
  (user) => user.json.person && user.json.person.email === slackUserEmail
);

return notionUser ? [{ json: { notionId: notionUser.json.id } }] : [];



Example 2: Data transformation#
To try the example yourself, download the example workflow and import it into n8n.
In the Join items Code node, enter this prompt:
Return a single line of text that has all usernames listed with a comma. Each username should be enquoted with a double quotation mark.

Example 3: Summarize data and create a Slack message#
To try the example yourself, download the example workflow and import it into n8n.
In the Summarize Code node, enter this prompt:
Create a markdown text for Slack that counts how many ideas, features and bugs have been submitted. The type of submission is saved in the property_type field. A feature has the property "Feature", a bug has the property "Bug" and an idea has the property "Bug". Also, list the five top submissions by vote in that message. Use "" as markdown for links.

Reference incoming node data explicitly#
If your incoming data contains nested fields, using dot notation to reference them can help the AI understand what data you want.

To try the example yourself, download the example workflow and import it into n8n.
In the second Code node, enter this prompt:
The data in "Mock data" represents a list of people. For each person, return a new item containing personal_info.first_name and work_info.job_title.

  const jobTitle = item.json.work_info.job_title;
  return {
    json: {
      firstName,
      jobTitle,
    },
  };
});
return newItems;

Custom variables#
Feature availability
Available on Self-hosted Enterprise and Pro Cloud plans.
You need access to the n8n instance owner account to create and edit variables. All users can use existing variables.
Available in version 0.225.0 and above.
Custom variables are read-only variables that you can use to store and reuse values in n8n workflows.
Variables are shared
When you create a variable, it's available to everyone on your n8n instance.
Create variables#
To create a new variable:
On the Variables page, select Add Variable.
Enter a Key and Value. The maximum key length is 50 characters, and the maximum value length is 220 characters. n8n limits the characters you can use in the key and value to lowercase and uppercase letters, numbers, and underscores (A-Z, a-z, 0-9, _).
Select Save. The variable is now available for use in all workflows in the n8n instance.
Edit and delete variables#
To edit or delete a variable:
On the Variables page, hover over the variable you want to change.
Select Edit or Delete.
Use variables in workflows#
You can access variables in the Code node and in expressions:
1
2
// Access a variable
$vars.<variable-name>



All variables are strings.
During workflow execution, n8n replaces the variables with the variable value. If the variable has no value, n8n treats its value as undefined. Workflows don't automatically fail in this case.
Variables are read-only. You must use the UI to change the values. If you need to set and access custom data within your workflow, use Workflow static data.
Date and time with Luxon#
Luxon is a JavaScript library that makes it easier to work with date and time. For full details of how to use Luxon, refer to Luxon's documentation.
n8n passes dates between nodes as strings, so you need to parse them. Luxon makes this easier.
Python support
Luxon is a JavaScript library. The two convenience variables created by n8n are available when using Python in the Code node, but their functionality is limited:
You can't perform Luxon operations on these variables. For example, there is no Python equivalent for $today.minus(...).
The generic Luxon functionality, such as Convert date string to Luxon, isn't available for Python users.
Variables#
n8n uses Luxon to provide two custom variables:
now: a Luxon object containing the current timestamp. Equivalent to DateTime.now().
today: a Luxon object containing the current timestamp, rounded down to the day. Equivalent to DateTime.now().set({ hour: 0, minute: 0, second: 0, millisecond: 0 }).
Note that these variables can return different time formats when cast as a string. This is the same behavior as Luxon's DateTime.now().
Expressions (JavaScript)
Code node (JavaScript)
Code node (Python)
1
2
3
4

6
{{$now}}
// n8n displays the ISO formatted timestamp
// For example 2022-03-09T14:02:37.065+00:00
{{"Today's date is " + $now}}
// n8n displays "Today's date is <unix timestamp>"
// For example "Today's date is 1646834498755"



n8n provides built-in convenience functions to support data transformation in expressions for dates. Refer to Data transformation functions | Dates for more information.
Date and time behavior in n8n#
Be aware of the following:
In a workflow, n8n converts dates and times to strings between nodes. Keep this in mind when doing arithmetic on dates and times from other nodes.
With vanilla JavaScript, you can convert a string to a date with new Date('2019-06-23'). In Luxon, you must use a function explicitly stating the format, such as DateTime.fromISO('2019-06-23') or DateTime.fromFormat("23-06-2019", "dd-MM-yyyy").
Setting the timezone in n8n#
Luxon uses the n8n timezone. This value is either:
Default: America/New York
A custom timezone for your n8n instance, set using the GENERIC_TIMEZONE environment variable.
A custom timezone for an individual workflow, configured in workflow settings.
Common tasks#
This section provides examples for some common operations. More examples, and detailed guidance, are available in Luxon's own documentation.
Convert date string to Luxon#
You can convert date strings and other date formats to a Luxon DateTime object. You can convert from standard formats and from arbitrary strings.
A difference between Luxon DateTime and JavaScript Date
With vanilla JavaScript, you can convert a string to a date with new Date('2019-06-23'). In Luxon, you must use a function explicitly stating the format, such as DateTime.fromISO('2019-06-23') or DateTime.fromFormat("23-06-2019", "dd-MM-yyyy").
If you have a date in a supported standard technical format:#
Most dates use fromISO(). This creates a Luxon DateTime from an ISO 8601 string. For example:
Expressions (JavaScript)
Code node (JavaScript)
1
{{DateTime.fromISO('2019-06-23T00:00:00.00')}}



Luxon's API documentation has more information on fromISO.
Luxon provides functions to handle conversions for a range of formats. Refer to Luxon's guide to Parsing technical formats for details.
If you have a date as a string that doesn't use a standard format:#
Use Luxon's Ad-hoc parsing. To do this, use the fromFormat() function, providing the string and a set of tokens that describe the format.
For example, you have n8n's founding date, 23rd June 2019, formatted as 23-06-2019. You want to turn this into a Luxon object:
Expressions (JavaScript)
Code node (JavaScript)
1
{{DateTime.fromFormat("23-06-2019", "dd-MM-yyyy")}}



When using ad-hoc parsing, note Luxon's warning about Limitations. If you see unexpected results, try their Debugging guide.
Get n days from today#
Get a number of days before or after today.
Expressions (JavaScript)
Code node (JavaScript)
For example, you want to set a field to always show the date seven days before the current date.
In the expressions editor, enter:
1
{{$today.minus({days: 7})}}



On the 23rd June 2019, this returns [Object: "2019-06-16T00:00:00.000+00:00"].
This example uses n8n's custom variable $today for convenience. It's the equivalent of DateTime.now().set({ hour: 0, minute: 0, second: 0, millisecond: 0 }).minus({days: 7}).
For more detailed information and examples, refer to:
Luxon's guide to math
Their API documentation on DateTime plus and DateTime minus
Create human-readable dates#
In Get n days from today, the example gets the date seven days before the current date, and returns it as [Object: "yyyy-mm-dd-T00:00:00.000+00:00"] (for expressions) or yyyy-mm-dd-T00:00:00.000+00:00 (in the Code node). To make this more readable, you can use Luxon's formatting functions.
For example, you want the field containing the date to be formatted as DD/MM/YYYY, so that on the 23rd June 2019, it returns 23/06/2019.
This expression gets the date seven days before today, and converts it to the DD/MM/YYYY format.
Expressions (JavaScript)
Code node (JavaScript)
1
{{$today.minus({days: 7}).toLocaleString()}}



You can alter the format. For example:
Expressions (JavaScript)
Code node (JavaScript)
1
{{$today.minus({days: 7}).toLocaleString({month: 'long', day: 'numeric', year: 'numeric'})}}



On 23rd June 2019, this returns "16 June 2019".
Refer to Luxon's guide on toLocaleString (strings for humans) for more information.
Get the time between two dates#
To get the time between two dates, use Luxon's diffs feature. This subtracts one date from another and returns a duration.
For example, get the number of months between two dates:
Expressions (JavaScript)
Code node (JavaScript)
1
{{DateTime.fromISO('2019-06-23').diff(DateTime.fromISO('2019-05-23'), 'months').toObject()}}



This returns [Object: {"months":1}].
Refer to Luxon's Diffs for more information.
A longer example: How many days to Christmas?#
This example brings together several Luxon features, uses JMESPath, and does some basic string manipulation.
The scenario: you want a countdown to 25th December. Every day, it should tell you the number of days remaining to Christmas. You don't want to update it for next year - it needs to seamlessly work for every year.
Expressions (JavaScript)
Code node (JavaScript)
1
{{"There are " + $today.diff(DateTime.fromISO($today.year + '-12-25'), 'days').toObject().days.toString().substring(1) + " days to Christmas!"}}



This outputs "There are <number of days> days to Christmas!". For example, on 9th March, it outputs "There are 291 days to Christmas!".
A detailed explanation of what the expression does:
{{: indicates the start of the expression.
"There are ": a string.
+: used to join two strings.
$today.diff(): This is similar to the example in Get the time between two dates, but it uses n8n's custom $today variable.
DateTime.fromISO($today.year + '-12-25'), 'days': this part gets the current year using $today.year, turns it into an ISO string along with the month and date, and then takes the whole ISO string and converts it to a Luxon DateTime data structure. It also tells Luxon that you want the duration in days.
toObject() turns the result of diff() into a more usable object. At this point, the expression returns [Object: {"days":-<number-of-days>}]. For example, on 9th March, [Object: {"days":-291}].
.days uses JMESPath syntax to retrieve just the number of days from the object. For more information on using JMESPath with n8n, refer to our JMESpath documentation. This gives you the number of days to Christmas, as a negative number.
.toString().substring(1) turns the number into a string and removes the -.
+ " days to Christmas!": another string, with a + to join it to the previous string.
}}: indicates the end of the expression.
Query JSON with JMESPath#
JMESPath is a query language for JSON that you can use to extract and transform elements from a JSON document. For full details of how to use JMESPath, refer to the JMESPath documentation.
The jmespath() method#
n8n provides a custom method, jmespath(). Use this method to perform a search on a JSON object using the JMESPath query language.
The basic syntax is:
JavaScript
Python
1
$jmespath(object, searchString)



To help understand what the method does, here is the equivalent longer JavaScript:
1
2
var jmespath = require('jmespath');
jmespath.search(object, searchString);



Expressions must be single-line
The longer code example doesn't work in Expressions, as they must be single-line.
object is a JSON object, such as the output of a previous node. searchString is an expression written in the JMESPath query language. The JMESPath Specification provides a list of supported expressions, while their Tutorial and Examples provide interactive examples.
Search parameter order
The examples in the JMESPath Specification follow the pattern search(searchString, object). The JMESPath JavaScript library, which n8n uses, supports search(object, searchString) instead. This means that when using examples from the JMESPath documentation, you may need to change the order of the search function parameters.
Common tasks#
This section provides examples for some common operations. More examples, and detailed guidance, are available in JMESPath's own documentation.
When trying out these examples, you need to set the Code node Mode to Run Once for Each Item.
Apply a JMESPath expression to a collection of elements with projections#
From the JMESPath projections documentation:
Projections are one of the key features of JMESPath. Use it to apply an expression to a collection of elements. JMESPath supports five kinds of projections:
List Projections
Slice Projections
Object Projections
Flatten Projections
Filter Projections
The following example shows basic usage of list, slice, and object projections. Refer to the JMESPath projections documentation for detailed explanations of each projection type, and more examples.

Refer to Custom executions data for more information.
getWorkflowStaticData(type)#
This gives access to the static workflow data.
Experimental feature
Static data isn't available when testing workflows. The workflow must be active and called by a trigger or webhook to save static data.
This feature may behave unreliably under high-frequency workflow executions.
You can save data directly in the workflow. This data should be small.
As an example: you can save a timestamp of the last item processed from an RSS feed or database. It will always return an object. Properties can then read, delete or set on that object. When the workflow execution succeeds, n8n checks automatically if the data has changed and saves it, if necessary.
There are two types of static data, global and node. Global static data is the same in the whole workflow. Every node in the workflow can access it. The node static data is unique to the node. Only the node that set it can retrieve it again.
Example with global data:

// Get the global workflow static data

// Delete data

Retrieve linked items from earlier in the workflow#
Every item in a node's input data links back to the items used in previous nodes to generate it. This is useful if you need to retrieve linked items from further back than the immediate previous node.
To access the linked items from earlier in the workflow, use ("<node-name>").itemMatching(currentNodeinputIndex).
For example, consider a workflow that does the following:

Expressions cookbook#
This section contains examples and recipes for tasks you can do with expressions.
Python support
You can use Python in the Code node. It isn't available in expressions.
Check incoming data
Common issues
Related resources#
Built-in methods and variables reference
Expressions
Check incoming data#
At times, you may want to check the incoming data. If the incoming data doesn't match a condition, you may want to return a different value. For example, you want to check if a variable from the previous node is empty and return a string if it's empty. Use the following code snippet to return not found if the variable is empty.
1
{{$json["variable_name"]? $json["variable_name"] :"not found"}}



The above expression uses the ternary operator. You can learn more about the ternary operator here.
As an alternative, you can use the nullish coalescing operator (??) or the logical or operator (||):
1
2
{{ $x ?? "default value" }}
{{ $x || "default value" }}



In either of the above two cases, the value of $x will be used if it's set to a non-null, non-false value. The string default value is the fallback value.
Expressions common issues#
Here are some common errors and issues related to expressions and steps to resolve or troubleshoot them.
The 'JSON Output' in item 0 contains invalid JSON#
This error occurs when you use JSON mode but don't provide a valid JSON object. Depending on the problem with the JSON object, the error sometimes display as The 'JSON Output' in item 0 does not contain a valid JSON object.
To resolve this, make sure that the code you provide is valid JSON:
Check the JSON with a JSON validator.
Check that your JSON object doesn't reference undefined input data. This may occur if the incoming data doesn't always include the same fields.
Can't get data for expression#
This error occurs when n8n can't retrieve the data referenced by an expression. Often, this happens when the preceding node hasn't been run yet.
Another variation of this may appear as Referenced node is unexecuted. In that case, the full text of this error will tell you the exact node that isn't executing in this format:
An expression references the node '<node-name>', but it hasn’t been executed yet. Either change the expression, or re-wire your workflow to make sure that node executes first.
To begin troubleshooting, test the workflow up to the named node.
For nodes that use JavaScript or other custom code, you can check if a previous node has executed before trying to use its value by checking the following:
1
$("<node-name>").isExecuted



As an example, this JSON references the parameters of the input data. This error will display if you test this step without connecting it to another node:
1
2
3
{
  "my_field_1": {{ $input.params }}
}



Invalid syntax#
This error occurs when you use an expression that has a syntax error.
For example, the expression in this JSON includes a trailing period, which results in an invalid syntax error:
1
2
3
4
{
  "my_field_1": "value",
  "my_field_2": {{ $('If').item.json. }}
}



To resolve this error, check your expression syntax to make sure they follow the expected format.

Get the binary data buffer#
The binary data buffer contains all the binary file data processed by a workflow. You need to access it if you want to perform operations on the binary data, such as:
Manipulating the data: for example, adding column headers to a CSV file.
Using the data in calculations: for example, calculating a hash value based on it.
Complex HTTP requests: for example, combining file upload with sending other data formats.
Not available in Python
getBinaryDataBuffer() isn't supported when using Python.
You can access the buffer using n8n's getBinaryDataBuffer() function:
1
2
3
4
5
6
/* 
* itemIndex: number. The index of the item in the input data.
* binaryPropertyName: string. The name of the binary property. 
* The default in the Read/Write File From Disk node is 'data'. 
*/
let binaryDataBufferItem = await this.helpers.getBinaryDataBuffer(itemIndex, binaryPropertyName);



For example:
1
2
let binaryDataBufferItem = await this.helpers.getBinaryDataBuffer(0, 'data');
// Returns the data in the binary buffer for the first input item



You should always use the getBinaryDataBuffer() function, and avoid using older methods of directly accessing the buffer, such as targeting it with expressions like items[0].binary.data.data.
Output to the browser console with console.log() or print() in the Code node#
You can use console.log() or print() in the Code node to help when writing and debugging your code.
For help opening your browser console, refer to this guide by Balsamiq.
console.log (JavaScript)#
For technical information on console.log(), refer to the MDN developer docs.
For example, copy the following code into a Code node, then open your console and run the node:
1
2
let a = "apple";
console.log(a);



print (Python)#
For technical information on print(), refer to the Real Python's guide.
For example, set your Code node Language to Python, copy the following code into the node, then open your console and run the node:
1
2
a = "apple"
print(a)



Handling an output of [object Object]#
If the console displays [object Object] when you print, check the data type, then convert it as needed.
To check the data type:
1
print(type(myData))



JsProxy#
If type() outputs <class 'pyodide.ffi.JsProxy'>, you need to convert the JsProxy to a native Python object using to_py(). This occurs when working with data in the n8n node data structure, such as node inputs and outputs. For example, if you want to print the data from a previous node in the workflow:
1
2
3
4
5
6
previousNodeData = _("<node-name>").all();
for item in previousNodeData:
	# item is of type <class 'pyodide.ffi.JsProxy'>
	# You need to convert it to a Dict
	itemDict = item.json.to_py()
	print(itemDict)



Refer to the Pyodide documentation on JsProxy for more information on this class.
Examples using n8n's HTTP Request node#
The HTTP Request node is one of the most versatile nodes in n8n. Use this node to make HTTP requests to query data from any app or service with a REST API.
Refer to HTTP Request for information on node settings.
Pagination
Related resources#
HTTP Request
Built-in methods and variables reference
Expressions
Pagination in the HTTP Request node#
The HTTP Request node supports pagination. This page provides some example configurations, including using the HTTP node variables.
Refer to HTTP Request for more information on the node.
API differences
Different APIs implement pagination in different ways. Check the API documentation for the API you're using for details. You need to find out things like:
Does the API provide the URL for the next page?
Are there API-specific limits on page size or page number?
The structure of the data that the API returns.
Enable pagination#
In the HTTP Request node, select Add Option > Pagination.
Use a URL from the response to get the next page using $response#
If the API returns the URL of the next page in its response:
Set Pagination Mode to Response Contains Next URL. n8n displays the parameters for this option.
In Next URL, use an expression to set the URL. The exact expression depends on the data returned by your API. For example, if the API includes a parameter called next-page in the response body:
1
{{ $response.body["next-page"] }}



Get the next page by number using $pageCount#
If the API you're using supports targeting a specific page by number:
Set Pagination Mode to Update a Parameter in Each Request.
Set Type to Query.
Enter the Name of the query parameter. This depends on your API and is usually described in its documentation. For example, some APIs use a query parameter named page to set the page. So Name would be page.
Hover over Value and toggle Expression on.
Enter {{ $pageCount + 1 }}
$pageCount is the number of pages the HTTP Request node has fetched. It starts at zero. Most API pagination counts from one (the first page is page one). This means that adding +1 to $pageCount means the node fetches page one on its first loop, page two on its second, and so on.
Navigate pagination through body parameters#
If the API you're using allows you to paginate through the body parameters:
Set the HTTP Request Method to POST
Set Pagination Mode to Update a Parameter in Each Request.
Select Body in the Type parameter.
Enter the Name of the body parameter. This depends on the API you're using. page is a common key name.
Hover over Value and toggle Expression on.
Enter {{ $pageCount + 1 }}
Set the page size in the query#
If the API you're using supports choosing the page size in the query:
Select Send Query Parameters in main node parameters (this is the parameters you see when you first open the node, not the settings within options).
Enter the Name of the query parameter. This depends on your API. For example, a lot of APIs use a query parameter named limit to set page size. So Name would be limit.
In Value, enter your page size.

npm#
npm is a quick way to get started with n8n on your local machine. You must have Node.js installed. n8n requires Node.js 18 or above.
Latest and Next versions
n8n releases a new minor version most weeks. The latest version is for production use. next is the most recent release. You should treat next as a beta: it may be unstable. To report issues, use the forum.
Current latest: 1.99.1
Current next: 1.100.1
Try n8n with npx#
You can try n8n without installing it using npx.
From the terminal, run:
1
npx n8n



This command will download everything that's needed to start n8n. You can then access n8n and start building workflows by opening http://localhost:5678.
Install globally with npm#
To install n8n globally, use npm:
1
npm install n8n -g



To install or update to a specific version of n8n use the @ syntax to specify the version. For example:
1
npm install -g n8n@0.126.1



To install next:
1
npm install -g n8n@next



After the installation, start n8n by running:
1
2
3
n8n
# or
n8n start



Next steps#
Try out n8n using the Quickstarts.
Updating#
To update your n8n instance to the latest version, run:
1
npm update -g n8n



To install the next version:
1
npm install -g n8n@next



n8n with tunnel#
Danger
Use this for local development and testing. It isn't safe to use it in production.
To use webhooks for trigger nodes of external services like GitHub, n8n has to be reachable from the web. n8n runs a tunnel service that can redirect requests from n8n's servers to your local n8n instance.
Start n8n with --tunnel by running:
1
n8n start --tunnel



Reverting an upgrade#
Install the older version that you want to go back to.
If the upgrade involved a database migration:
Check the feature documentation and release notes to see if there are any manual changes you need to make.
Run n8n db:revert on your current version to roll back the database. If you want to revert more than one database migration, you need to repeat this process.
Windows troubleshooting#
If you are experiencing issues running n8n on Windows, make sure your Node.js environment is correctly set up. Follow Microsoft's guide to Install NodeJS on Windows.
Docker Installation#
Docker offers the following advantages:
Installs n8n in a clean environment.
Easier setup for your preferred database.
Can avoid issues due to different operating systems, as Docker provides a consistent system.
Can avoid compatibility issues due to differences in operating systems and tools.
Makes migrating to new hosts or environments more straightforward.
You can also use n8n in Docker with Docker Compose. You can find Docker Compose configurations for various architectures in the n8n-hosting repository.
Self-hosting knowledge prerequisites
Self-hosting n8n requires technical knowledge, including:
Setting up and configuring servers and containers
Managing application resources and scaling
Securing servers and applications
Configuring n8n
n8n recommends self-hosting for expert users. Mistakes can lead to data loss, security issues, and downtime. If you aren't experienced at managing servers, n8n recommends n8n Cloud.
Prerequisites#
Before proceeding, install Docker Desktop.
Linux Users
Docker Desktop is available for Mac and Windows. Linux users must install Docker Engine and Docker Compose individually for your distribution.
Latest and Next versions
n8n releases a new minor version most weeks. The latest version is for production use. next is the most recent release. You should treat next as a beta: it may be unstable. To report issues, use the forum.
Current latest: 1.99.1
Current next: 1.100.1
Starting n8n#
From your terminal, run:
1
2
3
docker volume create n8n_data

docker run -it --rm --name n8n -p 5678:5678 -v n8n_data:/home/node/.n8n docker.n8n.io/n8nio/n8n



This command creates a volume to store persistent data, downloads the required n8n image, and starts your container, exposed on port 5678. To save your work between container restarts, it also mounts a docker volume, n8n_data, to persist your data locally.
Once running, you can access n8n by opening: http://localhost:5678
Using with PostgreSQL#
By default, n8n uses SQLite to save credentials, past executions, and workflows. n8n also supports PostgreSQL, configurable using environment variables as detailed below.
When using PostgreSQL, it's still important to persist the data stored in the /home/node/.n8n folder. This includes n8n user data and, even more importantly, the encryption key for credentials. It's also the name of the webhook when using the n8n tunnel.
If n8n can't find the /home/node/.n8n directory on startup, it automatically creates one. In this case, all existing credentials that n8n saved with a different encryption key will no longer work.
Keep in mind
While persisting the /home/node/.n8n directory with PostgreSQL is the recommended best practice, it's not explicitly required. You can provide the encryption key by passing the N8N_ENCRYPTION_KEY environment variable when starting your Docker container.
To use n8n with PostgreSQL, execute the following commands, replacing the placeholders (depicted within angled brackets, for example <POSTGRES_USER>) with your actual values:
1

 -e DB_POSTGRESDB_PASSWORD=<POSTGRES_PASSWORD> \
 -v n8n_data:/home/node/.n8n \
 docker.n8n.io/n8nio/n8n



You can find a complete docker-compose file for PostgreSQL in the n8n hosting repository.
Setting timezone#
To define the timezone n8n should use, you can set the GENERIC_TIMEZONE environment variable. Schedule-oriented nodes, like the Schedule Trigger node use this to determine the correct timezone.
You can set the system timezone, which controls what some scripts and commands like date return, using the TZ environment variable.
This example sets the same timezone for both variables:

 -e GENERIC_TIMEZONE="Europe/Berlin" \
 -e TZ="Europe/Berlin" \
 -v n8n_data:/home/node/.n8n \
 docker.n8n.io/n8nio/n8n



Updating#
To update n8n, in Docker Desktop, navigate to the Images tab and select Pull from the context menu to download the latest n8n image:

You can also use the command line to pull the latest, or a specific version:
1

Select the project to host the Droplet, or create a new project.
In your project, select Droplets from the Manage menu.
Create a new Droplet using the Docker image available on the Marketplace tab.
Droplet resources
When creating the Droplet, DigitalOcean asks you to choose a plan. For most usage levels, a basic shared CPU plan is enough.
SSH key or Password
DigitalOcean lets you choose between SSH key and password-based authentication. SSH keys are considered more secure.
Log in to your Droplet and create new user#
The rest of this guide requires you to log in to the Droplet using a terminal with SSH. Refer to How to Connect to Droplets with SSH for more information.
You should create a new user, to avoid working as the root user:
Log in as root.
Create a new user:
1
adduser <username>



Follow the prompts in the CLI to finish creating the user.
Grant the new user administrative privileges:
1
usermod -aG sudo <username>




You can now run commands with superuser privileges by using sudo before the command.
Follow the steps to set up SSH for the new user: Add Public Key Authentication.
Log out of the droplet.
Log in using SSH as the new user.
Clone configuration repository#
Docker Compose, n8n, and Caddy require a series of folders and configuration files. You can clone these from this repository into the home folder of the logged-in user on your Droplet. The following steps will tell you which file to change and what changes to make.
Clone the repository with the following command:
1
git clone https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n-docker-caddy.git



And change directory to the root of the repository you cloned:
1
cd n8n-docker-caddy



Default folders and files#
The host operating system (the DigitalOcean Droplet) copies the two folders you created to Docker containers to make them available to Docker. The two folders are:
caddy_config: Holds the Caddy configuration files.
local_files: A folder for files you upload or add using n8n.
Create Docker volumes#
To persist the Caddy cache between restarts and speed up start times, create a Docker volume that Docker reuses between restarts:
1
sudo docker volume create caddy_data



Create a Docker volume for the n8n data:
1
sudo docker volume create n8n_data



Set up DNS#
n8n typically operates on a subdomain. Create a DNS record with your provider for the subdomain and point it to the IP address of the Droplet. The exact steps for this depend on your DNS provider, but typically you need to create a new "A" record for the n8n subdomain. DigitalOcean provide An Introduction to DNS Terminology, Components, and Concepts.
Open ports#
n8n runs as a web application, so the Droplet needs to allow incoming access to traffic on port 80 for non-secure traffic, and port 443 for secure traffic.
Open the following ports in the Droplet's firewall by running the following two commands:
1
2
sudo ufw allow 80
sudo ufw allow 443



Configure n8n#
n8n needs some environment variables set to pass to the application running in the Docker container. The example .env file contains placeholders you need to replace with values of your own.
Open the file with the following command:
1
nano .env



The file contains inline comments to help you know what to change.
Refer to Environment variables for n8n environment variables details.
The Docker Compose file#
The Docker Compose file (docker-compose.yml) defines the services the application needs, in this case Caddy and n8n.
The Caddy service definition defines the ports it uses and the local volumes to copy to the containers.
The n8n service definition defines the ports it uses, the environment variables n8n needs to run (some defined in the .env file), and the volumes it needs to copy to the containers.
The Docker Compose file uses the environment variables set in the .env file, so you shouldn't need to change it's content, but to take a look, run the following command:
1
nano docker-compose.yml



Configure Caddy#
Caddy needs to know which domains it should serve, and which port to expose to the outside world. Edit the Caddyfile file in the caddy_config folder.
1
nano caddy_config/Caddyfile



Change the placeholder domain to yours. If you followed the steps to name the subdomain n8n, your full domain is similar to n8n.example.com. The n8n in the reverse_proxy setting tells Caddy to use the service definition defined in the docker-compose.yml file:
1
2
3
4
5
n8n.<domain>.<suffix> {
    reverse_proxy n8n:5678 {
      flush_interval -1
    }
}



If you were to use automate.example.com, your Caddyfile may look something like:
1
2
3
4
5
automate.example.com {
    reverse_proxy n8n:5678 {
      flush_interval -1
    }
}



Start Docker Compose#
Start n8n and Caddy with the following command:
1
sudo docker compose up -d



This may take a few minutes.
Test your setup#
In your browser, open the URL formed of the subdomain and domain name defined earlier. Enter the user name and password defined earlier, and you should be able to access n8n.
Stop n8n and Caddy#
You can stop n8n and Caddy with the following command:
1
sudo docker compose stop



Updating#
If you run n8n using a Docker Compose file, follow these steps to update n8n:
1
 2
 3

Hosting n8n on Heroku#
This hosting guide shows you how to self-host n8n on Heroku. It uses:
Docker Compose to create and define the application components and how they work together.
Heroku's PostgreSQL service to host n8n's data storage.
A Deploy to Heroku button offering a one click, with minor configuration, deployment.
Self-hosting knowledge prerequisites
Self-hosting n8n requires technical knowledge, including:
Setting up and configuring servers and containers
Managing application resources and scaling
Securing servers and applications
Configuring n8n
n8n recommends self-hosting for expert users. Mistakes can lead to data loss, security issues, and downtime. If you aren't experienced at managing servers, n8n recommends n8n Cloud.
Latest and Next versions
n8n releases a new minor version most weeks. The latest version is for production use. next is the most recent release. You should treat next as a beta: it may be unstable. To report issues, use the forum.
Current latest: 1.99.1
Current next: 1.100.1
Use the deployment template to create a Heroku project#
The quickest way to get started with deploying n8n to Heroku is using the Deploy to Heroku button:

This opens the Create New App page on Heroku. Set a name for the project, and choose the region to deploy the project to.
Configure environment variables#
Heroku pre-fills the configuration options defined in the env section of the app.json file, which also sets default values for the environment variables n8n uses.
You can change any of these values to suit your needs. You must change the following values:
N8N_ENCRYPTION_KEY, which n8n uses to encrypt user account details before saving to the database.
WEBHOOK_URL should match the application name you create to ensure that webhooks have the correct URL.
Deploy n8n#
Select Deploy app.
After Heroku builds and deploys the app it provides links to Manage App or View the application.
Heroku and DNS
Refer to the Heroku documentation to find out how to connect your domain to a Heroku application.
Changing the deployment template#
You can make changes to the deployment template by forking the repository and deploying from you fork.
The Dockerfile#
By default the Dockerfile pulls the latest n8n image, if you want to use a different or fixed version, then update the image tag on the top line of the Dockerfile.
Heroku and exposing ports#
Heroku doesn't allow Docker-based applications to define an exposed port with the EXPOSE command. Instead, Heroku provides a PORT environment variable that it dynamically populates at application runtime. The entrypoint.sh file overrides the default Docker image command to instead set the port variable that Heroku provides. You can then access n8n on port 80 in a web browser.
Docker limitations with Heroku
Read this guide for more details on the limitations of using Docker with Heroku.
Configuring Heroku#
The heroku.yml file defines the application you want to create on Heroku. It consists of two sections:
setup > addons defines the Heroku addons to use. In this case, the PostgreSQL database addon.
The build section defines how Heroku builds the application. In this case it uses the Docker buildpack to build a web service based on the supplied Dockerfile.

Create a server#
Log in to the Hetzner Cloud Console.
Select the project to host the server, or create a new project by selecting + NEW PROJECT.
Select + CREATE SERVER on the project tile you want to add it to.
You can change most of the settings to suit your needs, but as this guide uses Docker to run the application, under the Image section, select "Docker CE" from the APPS tab.
Type
When creating the server, Hetzner asks you to choose a plan. For most usage levels, the CPX11 type is enough.
SSH keys
Hetzner lets you choose between SSH and password-based authentication. SSH is more secure. The rest of this guide assumes you are using SSH.
Log in to your server#
The rest of this guide requires you to log in to the server using a terminal with SSH. Refer to Access with SSH/rsync/BorgBackup for more information. You can find the public IP in the listing of the servers in your project.
Install Docker Compose#
The Hetzner Docker app image doesn't have Docker compose installed. Install it with the following commands:
1
2
apt update && apt -y upgrade
apt install docker-compose-plugin



Clone configuration repository#
Docker Compose, n8n, and Caddy require a series of folders and configuration files. You can clone these from this repository into the root user folder of the server. The following steps will tell you which file to change and what changes to make.
Clone the repository with the following command:

Hosting n8n on Amazon Web Services#
This hosting guide shows you how to self-host n8n with Amazon Web Services (AWS). It uses n8n with Postgres as a database backend using Kubernetes to manage the necessary resources and reverse proxy.
Hosting options#
AWS offers several ways suitable for hosting n8n, including EC2 (virtual machines), and EKS (containers running with Kubernetes).
This guide uses EKS as the hosting option. Using Kubernetes requires some additional complexity and configuration, but is the best method for scaling n8n as demand changes.
Prerequisites#
The steps in this guide use a mix of the AWS UI and the eksctl CLI tool for EKS.
While not mentioned in the documentation for eksctl, you also need to install the AWS CLI tool, and configure authentication of the tool.
Self-hosting knowledge prerequisites
Self-hosting n8n requires technical knowledge, including:
Setting up and configuring servers and containers
Managing application resources and scaling
Securing servers and applications
Configuring n8n
n8n recommends self-hosting for expert users. Mistakes can lead to data loss, security issues, and downtime. If you aren't experienced at managing servers, n8n recommends n8n Cloud.
Latest and Next versions

Current latest: 1.99.1
Current next: 1.100.1
Create a cluster#
Use the eksctl tool to create a cluster specifying a name and a region with the following command:
1
eksctl create cluster --name n8n --region <your-aws-region>



This can take a while to create the cluster.
Once the cluster is created, eksctl automatically sets the kubectl context to the cluster.
Clone configuration repository#
Kubernetes and n8n require a series of configuration files. You can clone these from this repository. The following steps tell you what each file does, and what settings you need to change.
Clone the repository with the following command:
1
git clone https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n-kubernetes-hosting.git -b aws



And change directory to the root of the repository you cloned:
1
cd n8n-kubernetes-hosting



Configure Postgres#
For larger scale n8n deployments, Postgres provides a more robust database backend than SQLite.
Configure volume for persistent storage#
To maintain data between pod restarts, the Postgres deployment needs a persistent volume. The default AWS storage class, gp2, is suitable for this purpose. This is defined in the postgres-claaim0-persistentvolumeclaim.yaml manifest.
1
2
3
4
5
6
…
spec:
  storageClassName: gp2
  accessModes:
    - ReadWriteOnce
…



Postgres environment variables#
Postgres needs some environment variables set to pass to the application running in the containers.
The example postgres-secret.yaml file contains placeholders you need to replace with values of your own for user details and the database to use.
The postgres-deployment.yaml manifest then uses the values from this manifest file to send to the application pods.
Configure n8n#
Create a volume for file storage#
While not essential for running n8n, using persistent volumes helps maintain files uploaded while using n8n and if you want to persist manual n8n encryption keys between restarts, which saves a file containing the key into file storage during startup.
The n8n-claim0-persistentvolumeclaim.yaml manifest creates this, and the n8n Deployment mounts that claim in the volumes section of the n8n-deployment.yaml manifest.
1
2
3
4
5
6
…
volumes:
  - name: n8n-claim0
    persistentVolumeClaim:
      claimName: n8n-claim0
…



Pod resources#
Kubernetes lets you specify the minimum resources application containers need and the limits they can run to. The example YAML files cloned above contain the following in the resources section of the n8n-deployment.yaml file:
1
2
3
4
5
6
7
…
resources:
  requests:
    memory: "250Mi"
  limits:
    memory: "500Mi"
…    



This defines a minimum of 250mb per container, a maximum of 500mb, and lets Kubernetes handle CPU. You can change these values to match your own needs. As a guide, here are the resources values for the n8n cloud offerings:
Start: 320mb RAM, 10 millicore CPU burstable
Pro (10k executions): 640mb RAM, 20 millicore CPU burstable
Pro (50k executions): 1280mb RAM, 80 millicore CPU burstable
Optional: Environment variables#
You can configure n8n settings and behaviors using environment variables.
Create an n8n-secret.yaml file. Refer to Environment variables for n8n environment variables details.
Deployments#
The two deployment manifests (n8n-deployment.yaml and postgres-deployment.yaml) define the n8n and Postgres applications to Kubernetes.
The manifests define the following:
Send the environment variables defined to each application pod
Define the container image to use
Set resource consumption limits
The volumes defined earlier and volumeMounts to define the path in the container to mount volumes.
Scaling and restart policies. The example manifests define one instance of each pod. You should change this to meet your needs.
Services#
The two service manifests (postgres-service.yaml and n8n-service.yaml) expose the services to the outside world using the Kubernetes load balancer using ports 5432 and 5678 respectively by default.
Send to Kubernetes cluster#
Send all the manifests to the cluster by running the following command in the n8n-kubernetes-hosting directory:
1
kubectl apply -f .



Namespace error
You may see an error message about not finding an "n8n" namespace as that resources isn't ready yet. You can run the same command again, or apply the namespace manifest first with the following command:
1
kubectl apply -f namespace.yaml



Set up DNS#
n8n typically operates on a subdomain. Create a DNS record with your provider for the subdomain and point it to a static address of the instance.
To find the address of the n8n service running on the instance:
Open the Clusters section of the Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service page in the AWS console.
Select the name of the cluster to open its configuration page.
Select the Resources tab, then Service and networking > Services.
Select the n8n service and copy the Load balancer URLs value. Use this value suffixed with the n8n service port (5678) for DNS.
Use HTTP
This guide uses HTTP connections for the services it defines, for example in n8n-deployment.yaml. However, if you click the Load balancer URLs value, EKS takes you to an "HTTPS" URL which results in an error. To solve this, when you open the n8n subdomain, make sure to use HTTP.
Delete resources#
If you need to delete the setup, you can remove the resources created by the manifests with the following command:
1
kubectl delete -f .

Current next: 1.100.1
Hosting options#
Azure offers several ways suitable for hosting n8n, including Azure Container Instances (optimized for running containers), Linux Virtual Machines, and Azure Kubernetes Service (containers running with Kubernetes).
This guide uses the Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) as the hosting option. Using Kubernetes requires some additional complexity and configuration, but is the best method for scaling n8n as demand changes.
The steps in this guide use a mix of the Azure UI and command line tool, but you can use either to accomplish most tasks.
Open the Azure Kubernetes Service#
From the Azure portal select Kubernetes services.
Create a cluster#
From the Kubernetes services page, select Create > Create a Kubernetes cluster.
You can select any of the configuration options that suit your needs, then select Create when done.
Set Kubectl context#
The remainder of the steps in this guide require you to set the Azure instance as the Kubectl context. You can find the connection details for a cluster instance by opening its details page and then the Connect button. The resulting code snippets shows the steps to paste and run into a terminal to change your local Kubernetes settings to use the new cluster.
Clone configuration repository#
Kubernetes and n8n require a series of configuration files. You can clone these from this repository. The following steps tell you which file configures what and what you need to change.
Clone the repository with the following command:
1
git clone https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n-kubernetes-hosting.git -b azure



And change directory to the root of the repository you cloned:
1
cd azure



Configure Postgres#
For larger scale n8n deployments, Postgres provides a more robust database backend than SQLite.
Configure volume for persistent storage#
To maintain data between pod restarts, the Postgres deployment needs a persistent volume. The default storage class is suitable for this purpose and is defined in the postgres-claim0-persistentvolumeclaim.yaml manifest.
Specialized storage classes
If you have specialised or higher requirements for storage classes, read more on the options Azure offers in the documentation.
Postgres environment variables#
Postgres needs some environment variables set to pass to the application running in the containers.
The example postgres-secret.yaml file contains placeholders you need to replace with your own values. Postgres will use these details when creating the database..
The postgres-deployment.yaml manifest then uses the values from this manifest file to send to the application pods.
Configure n8n#
Create a volume for file storage#
While not essential for running n8n, using persistent volumes is required for:
Using nodes that interact with files, such as the binary data node.
If you want to persist manual n8n encryption keys between restarts. This saves a file containing the key into file storage during startup.
The n8n-claim0-persistentvolumeclaim.yaml manifest creates this, and the n8n Deployment mounts that claim in the volumes section of the n8n-deployment.yaml manifest.

Optional: Environment variables#
You can configure n8n settings and behaviors using environment variables.
Create an n8n-secret.yaml file. Refer to Environment variables for n8n environment variables details.
Deployments#
The two deployment manifests (n8n-deployment.yaml and postgres-deployment.yaml) define the n8n and Postgres applications to Kubernetes.
The manifests define the following:
Send the environment variables defined to each application pod
Define the container image to use
Set resource consumption limits with the resources object
The volumes defined earlier and volumeMounts to define the path in the container to mount volumes.
Scaling and restart policies. The example manifests define one instance of each pod. You should change this to meet your needs.
Services#
The two service manifests (postgres-service.yaml and n8n-service.yaml) expose the services to the outside world using the Kubernetes load balancer using ports 5432 and 5678 respectively.
Send to Kubernetes cluster#
Send all the manifests to the cluster with the following command:
1
kubectl apply -f .



Namespace error
You may see an error message about not finding an "n8n" namespace as that resources isn't ready yet. You can run the same command again, or apply the namespace manifest first with the following command:

Current latest: 1.99.1
Current next: 1.100.1
Hosting options#
Google Cloud offers several options suitable for hosting n8n, including Cloud Run (optimized for running containers), Compute Engine (VMs), and Kubernetes Engine (containers running with Kubernetes).
This guide uses the Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) as the hosting option. Using Kubernetes requires some additional complexity and configuration, but is the best method for scaling n8n as demand changes.
Most of the steps in this guide use the Google Cloud UI, but you can also use the gcloud command line tool instead to undertake all the steps.
Create project#
GCP encourages you to create projects to logically organize resources and configuration. Create a new project for your n8n deployment from your Google Cloud Console: select the project dropdown menu and then the NEW PROJECT button. Then select the newly created project. As you follow the other steps in this guide, make sure you have the correct project selected.
Enable the Kubernetes Engine API#
GKE isn't enabled by default. Search for "Kubernetes" in the top search bar and select "Kubernetes Engine" from the results.
Select ENABLE to enable the Kubernetes Engine API for this project.
Create a cluster#
From the GKE service page, select Clusters > CREATE. Make sure you select the "Standard" cluster option, n8n doesn't work with an "Autopilot" cluster. You can leave the cluster configuration on defaults unless there's anything specifically you need to change, such as location.
Set Kubectl context#
The rest of the steps in this guide require you to set the GCP instance as the Kubectl context. You can find the connection details for a cluster instance by opening its details page and selecting CONNECT. The displayed code snippet shows a connection string for the gcloud CLI tool. Paste and run the code snippet in the gcloud CLI to change your local Kubernetes settings to use the new gcloud cluster.
Clone configuration repository#
Kubernetes and n8n require a series of configuration files. You can clone these from this repository locally. The following steps explain the file configuration and how to add your information.
Clone the repository with the following command:
1
git clone https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n-kubernetes-hosting.git -b gcp



And change directory to the root of the repository you cloned:
1
cd n8n-kubernetes-hosting



Configure Postgres#
For larger scale n8n deployments, Postgres provides a more robust database backend than SQLite.
Create a volume for persistent storage#
To maintain data between pod restarts, the Postgres deployment needs a persistent volume. Running Postgres on GCP requires a specific Kubernetes Storage Class. You can read this guide for specifics, but the storage.yaml manifest creates it for you. You may want to change the regions to create the storage in under the allowedTopologies > matchedLabelExpressions > values key. By default, they're set to us-central.

…
allowedTopologies:
  - matchLabelExpressions:
      - key: failure-domain.beta.kubernetes.io/zone
        values:
          - us-central1-b
          - us-central1-c



Postgres environment variables#
Postgres needs some environment variables set to pass to the application running in the containers.
The example postgres-secret.yaml file contains placeholders you need to replace with your own values. Postgres will use these details when creating the database..
The postgres-deployment.yaml manifest then uses the values from this manifest file to send to the application pods.
Configure n8n#
Create a volume for file storage#
While not essential for running n8n, using persistent volumes is required for:
Using nodes that interact with files, such as the binary data node.
If you want to persist manual n8n encryption keys between restarts. This saves a file containing the key into file storage during startup.
The n8n-claim0-persistentvolumeclaim.yaml manifest creates this, and the n8n Deployment mounts that claim in the volumes section of the n8n-deployment.yaml manifest.
1
2
3

5
6
…
volumes:
  - name: n8n-claim0
    persistentVolumeClaim:
      claimName: n8n-claim0
…



Pod resources#
Kubernetes lets you optionally specify the minimum resources application containers need and the limits they can run to. The example YAML files cloned above contain the following in the resources section of the n8n-deployment.yaml and postgres-deployment.yaml files:
1
2
3
4
5
6
7
…
resources:
  requests:
    memory: "250Mi"
  limits:
    memory: "500Mi"
…    



This defines a minimum of 250mb per container, a maximum of 500mb, and lets Kubernetes handle CPU. You can change these values to match your own needs. As a guide, here are the resources values for the n8n cloud offerings:
Start: 320mb RAM, 10 millicore CPU burstable
Pro (10k executions): 640mb RAM, 20 millicore CPU burstable
Pro (50k executions): 1280mb RAM, 80 millicore CPU burstable
Optional: Environment variables#
You can configure n8n settings and behaviors using environment variables.
Create an n8n-secret.yaml file. Refer to Environment variables for n8n environment variables details.
Deployments#
The two deployment manifests (n8n-deployment.yaml and postgres-deployment.yaml) define the n8n and Postgres applications to Kubernetes.
The manifests define the following:
Send the environment variables defined to each application pod
Define the container image to use
Set resource consumption limits with the resources object
The volumes defined earlier and volumeMounts to define the path in the container to mount volumes.
Scaling and restart policies. The example manifests define one instance of each pod. You should change this to meet your needs.
Services#
The two service manifests (postgres-service.yaml and n8n-service.yaml) expose the services to the outside world using the Kubernetes load balancer using ports 5432 and 5678 respectively.
Send to Kubernetes cluster#
Send all the manifests to the cluster with the following command:
1
kubectl apply -f .



Namespace error
You may see an error message about not finding an "n8n" namespace as that resources isn't ready yet. You can run the same command again, or apply the namespace manifest first with the following command:
1
kubectl apply -f namespace.yaml



Set up DNS#
n8n typically operates on a subdomain. Create a DNS record with your provider for the subdomain and point it to the IP address of the n8n service. Find the IP address of the n8n service from the Services & Ingress menu item of the cluster you want to use under the Endpoints column.
GKE and IP addresses
Read this GKE tutorial for more details on how reserved IP addresses work with GKE and Kubernetes resources.
Delete resources#
Remove the resources created by the manifests with the following command:
1
kubectl delete -f .



Next steps#
Learn more about configuring and scaling n8n.
Or explore using n8n: try the Quickstarts.
Docker-Compose#
If you have already installed Docker and Docker-Compose, then you can start with step 3.
You can find Docker Compose configurations for various architectures in the n8n-hosting repository.
Self-hosting knowledge prerequisites
Self-hosting n8n requires technical knowledge, including:
Setting up and configuring servers and containers
Managing application resources and scaling
Securing servers and applications
Configuring n8n
n8n recommends self-hosting for expert users. Mistakes can lead to data loss, security issues, and downtime. If you aren't experienced at managing servers, n8n recommends n8n Cloud.
Latest and Next versions
n8n releases a new minor version most weeks. The latest version is for production use. next is the most recent release. You should treat next as a beta: it may be unstable. To report issues, use the forum.
Current latest: 1.99.1
Current next: 1.100.1
1. Install Docker and Docker Compose#
How you install Docker and Docker Compose can vary depending on the Linux distribution you use. You can find detailed instructions in both the Docker and Docker Compose installation documentation. The following example is for Ubuntu:

# Update and install Docker and Docker Compose
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install docker-ce docker-ce-cli containerd.io docker-buildx-plugin docker-compose-plugin



Verify that Docker and Docker Compose are available by typing:
1
2
docker --version
docker compose version



2. Optional: Non-root user access#
You can optionally grant access to run Docker without the sudo command.
To grant access to the user that you're currently logged in with (assuming they have sudo access), run:
1
2
3
sudo usermod -aG docker ${USER}
# Register the `docker` group memebership with current session without changing your primary group
exec sg docker newgrp



To grant access to a different user, type the following, substituting <USER_TO_RUN_DOCKER> with the appropriate username:
1
sudo usermod -aG docker <USER_TO_RUN_DOCKER>



You will need to run exec sg docker newgrp from any of that user's existing sessions for it to access the new group permissions.
You can verify that your current session recognizes the docker group by typing:
1
groups



3. DNS setup#
To host n8n online or on a network, create a dedicated subdomain pointed at your server.
Add an A record to route the subdomain accordingly:
Type: A
Name: n8n (or the desired subdomain)
IP address: (your server's IP address)
4. Create an .env file#
Create a project directory to store your n8n environment configuration and Docker Compose files and navigate inside:
1
2
mkdir n8n-compose
cd n8n-compose



Inside the n8n-compose directory, create an .env file to customize your n8n instance's details. Change it to match your own information:

# DOMAIN_NAME and SUBDOMAIN together determine where n8n will be reachable from
# The top level domain to serve from
DOMAIN_NAME=example.com

# The subdomain to serve from
SUBDOMAIN=n8n

# The above example serve n8n at: https://n8n.example.com

# Optional timezone to set which gets used by Cron and other scheduling nodes
# New York is the default value if not set
GENERIC_TIMEZONE=Europe/Berlin

# The email address to use for the TLS/SSL certificate creation
SSL_EMAIL=user@example.com



5. Create local files directory#
Inside your project directory, create a directory called local-files for sharing files between the n8n instance and the host system (for example, using the Read/Write Files from Disk node):
1
mkdir local-files



The Docker Compose file below can automatically create this directory, but doing it manually ensures that it's created with the right ownership and permissions.
6. Create Docker Compose file#
Create a compose.yaml file. Paste the following in the file:

      - n8n_data:/home/node/.n8n
      - ./local-files:/files

volumes:
  n8n_data:
  traefik_data:



The above Docker Compose file configures two containers: one for n8n, and one to run traefik, an application proxy to manage TLS/SSL certificates and handle routing.
It also creates and mounts two Docker Volumes and mounts the local-files directory you created earlier:
Name
Type
Container mount
Description
n8n_data
Volume
/home/node/.n8n
Where n8n saves its SQLite database file and encryption key.
traefik_data
Volume
/letsencrypt
Where traefik saves the TLS/SSL certificate data.
./local-files
Bind
/files
A local directory shared between the n8n instance and host. In n8n, use the /files path to read from and write to this directory.

7. Start Docker Compose#
You can now start n8n by typing:
1
sudo docker compose up -d



To stop the container, type:
1
sudo docker compose stop



8. Done#
You can now reach n8n using the subdomain + domain combination you defined in your .env file configuration. The above example would result in https://n8n.example.com.
n8n is only accessible using secure HTTPS, not over plain HTTP.

Update self-hosted n8n#
It's important to keep your n8n version up to date. This ensures you get the latest features and fixes.
Some tips when updating:
Update frequently: this avoids having to jump multiple versions at once, reducing the risk of a disruptive update. Try to update at least once a month.
Check the Release notes for breaking changes.
Use Environments to create a test version of your instance. Test the update there first.
For instructions on how to update, refer to the documentation for your installation method:
Installed with npm
Installed with Docker

Set environment variables by command line#
npm#
For npm, set your desired environment variables in terminal using the export command as shown below:
1
export <variable>=<value>



Docker#
In Docker you can use the -e flag from the command line:
1
2
3
4
5
docker run -it --rm \
 --name n8n \
 -p 5678:5678 \
 -e N8N_TEMPLATES_ENABLED="false" \
 docker.n8n.io/n8nio/n8n



Set environment variables using a file#
You can also configure n8n using a configuration file.
Only define the values that need to be different from the default in your configuration file. You can use multiple files. For example, you can have a file with generic base settings, and files with specific values for different environments.
npm#
Set the path to the JSON configuration file using the environment variable N8N_CONFIG_FILES:
1
2
3
4
5
6
7
8
# Bash - Single file
export N8N_CONFIG_FILES=/<path-to-config>/my-config.json
# Bash - Multiple files are comma-separated
export N8N_CONFIG_FILES=/<path-to-config>/my-config.json,/<path-to-config>/production.json

# PowerShell - Single file, persist for current user
# Note that setting scope (Process, User, Machine) has no effect on Unix systems
[Environment]::SetEnvironmentVariable('N8N_CONFIG_FILES', '<path-to-config>\config.json', 'User')



Example file:
1
 2
 3
 4
 5
 6
 7
 8
 9
10
11
{
 "executions": {
  "saveDataOnSuccess": "none"
 },
 "generic": {
  "timezone": "Europe/Berlin"
 },
 "nodes": {
  "exclude": "[\"n8n-nodes-base.executeCommand\",\"n8n-nodes-base.writeBinaryFile\"]"
 }
}



Formatting as JSON
You can't always work out the correct JSON from the Environment variables reference. For example, to set N8N_METRICS to true, you need to do:
1
2
3
4
5
6
7
{
	"endpoints": {
		"metrics": {
			"enable": true
		}
	}
}



Refer to the Schema file in the source code for full details of the expected settings.
Docker#
In Docker, you can set your environment variables in the n8n: environment: element of your docker-compose.yaml file.
For example:
1
2
3
n8n:
    environment:
      - N8N_TEMPLATES_ENABLED=false



Keeping sensitive data in separate files#
You can append _FILE to individual environment variables to provide their configuration in a separate file, enabling you to avoid passing sensitive details using environment variables. n8n loads the data from the file with the given name, making it possible to load data from Docker-Secrets and Kubernetes-Secrets.
Refer to Environment variables for details on each variable.
While most environment variables can use the _FILE suffix, it's more beneficial for sensitive data such as credentials and database configuration. Here are some examples:
1
 2
 3
 4
 5

Configuration examples#
This section contains examples for how to configure n8n to solve particular use cases.
Isolate n8n
Configure the Base URL
Configure custom SSL certificate authorities
Set a custom encryption key
Configure workflow timeouts
Specify custom nodes location
Enable modules in Code node
Set the timezone
Specify user folder path
Configure webhook URLs with reverse proxy
Enable Prometheus metrics
Isolate n8n#
By default, a self-hosted n8n instance sends data to n8n's servers. It notifies users about available updates, workflow templates, and diagnostics.
To prevent your n8n instance from connecting to n8n's servers, set these environment variables to false:
1
2
3
N8N_DIAGNOSTICS_ENABLED=false
N8N_VERSION_NOTIFICATIONS_ENABLED=false
N8N_TEMPLATES_ENABLED=false



Unset n8n's diagnostics configuration:
1
2
3
EXTERNAL_FRONTEND_HOOKS_URLS=
N8N_DIAGNOSTICS_CONFIG_FRONTEND=
N8N_DIAGNOSTICS_CONFIG_BACKEND=



Refer to Environment variables reference for more information on these variables.
Configure the Base URL for n8n's front end access#
Requires manual UI build
This use case involves configuring the VUE_APP_URL_BASE_API environmental variable which requires a manual build of the n8n-editor-ui package. You can't use it with the default n8n Docker image where the default setting for this variable is /, meaning that it uses the root-domain.
You can configure the Base URL that the front end uses to connect to the back end's REST API. This is relevant when you want to host n8n's front end and back end separately.
1
export VUE_APP_URL_BASE_API=https://n8n.example.com/



Refer to Environment variables reference for more information on this variable.Configure n8n to use your own certificate authority or self-signed certificate#
You can add your own certificate authority (CA) or self-signed certificate to n8n. This means you are able to trust a certain SSL certificate instead of trusting all invalid certificates, which is a potential security risk.
Available in version 1.42.0
This feature is only available in version 1.42.0+.
To use this feature you need to place your certificates in a folder and mount the folder to /opt/custom-certificates in the container.
Docker#
The examples below assume you have a folder called pki that contains your certificates in either the directory you run the command from or next to your docker compose file.
Docker CLI#
When using the CLI you can use the -v flag from the command line:
1
2
3
4
5
docker run -it --rm \
 --name n8n \
 -p 5678:5678 \
 -v ./pki:/opt/custom-certificates \
 docker.n8n.io/n8nio/n8n



Docker Compose#
1
2
3
4
5
6
7
8
9
name: n8n
services:
    n8n:
        volumes:
            - ./pki:/opt/custom-certificates
        container_name: n8n
        ports:
            - 5678:5678
        image: docker.n8n.io/n8nio/n8n



You should also give the right permissions to the imported certs. You can do this once the container is running (assuming n8n as the container name):
1
docker exec --user 0 n8n chown -R 1000:1000 /opt/custom-certificates

Set a custom encryption key#
n8n creates a random encryption key automatically on the first launch and saves it in the ~/.n8n folder. n8n uses that key to encrypt the credentials before they get saved to the database. If the key isn't yet in the settings file, you can set it using an environment variable, so that n8n uses your custom key instead of generating a new one.
In queue mode, you must specify the encryption key environment variable for all workers.
1
export N8N_ENCRYPTION_KEY=<SOME RANDOM STRING>



Refer to Environment variables reference for more information on this variable.
Configure workflow timeout settings#
A workflow times out and gets canceled after this time (in seconds). If the workflow runs in the main process, a soft timeout happens (takes effect after the current node finishes). If a workflow runs in its own process, n8n attempts a soft timeout first, then kills the process after waiting for a fifth of the given timeout duration.
EXECUTIONS_TIMEOUT default is -1. For example, if you want to set the timeout to one hour:
1
export EXECUTIONS_TIMEOUT=3600



You can also set maximum execution time (in seconds) for each workflow individually. For example, if you want to set maximum execution time to two hours:
1
export EXECUTIONS_TIMEOUT_MAX=7200



Refer to Environment variables reference for more information on these variables.
Specify location for your custom nodes#
Every user can add custom nodes that get loaded by n8n on startup. The default location is in the subfolder .n8n/custom of the user who started n8n.
You can define more folders with an environment variable:
1
export N8N_CUSTOM_EXTENSIONS="/home/jim/n8n/custom-nodes;/data/n8n/nodes"



Refer to Environment variables reference for more information on this variable.
Enable modules in Code node#
For security reasons, the Code node restricts importing modules. It's possible to lift that restriction for built-in and external modules by setting the following environment variables:
NODE_FUNCTION_ALLOW_BUILTIN: For built-in modules
NODE_FUNCTION_ALLOW_EXTERNAL: For external modules sourced from n8n/node_modules directory. External module support is disabled when an environment variable isn't set.

# Allows usage of all builtin modules
export NODE_FUNCTION_ALLOW_BUILTIN=*

# Allows usage of only crypto
export NODE_FUNCTION_ALLOW_BUILTIN=crypto

# Allows usage of only crypto and fs
export NODE_FUNCTION_ALLOW_BUILTIN=crypto,fs

# Allow usage of external npm modules.
export NODE_FUNCTION_ALLOW_EXTERNAL=moment,lodash



Refer to Environment variables reference for more information on these variables.
Set the self-hosted instance timezone#
The default timezone is America/New_York. For instance, the Schedule node uses it to know at what time the workflow should start. To set a different default timezone, set GENERIC_TIMEZONE to the appropriate value. For example, if you want to set the timezone to Berlin (Germany):
1
export GENERIC_TIMEZONE=Europe/Berlin



You can find the name of your timezone here.
Refer to Environment variables reference for more information on this variable.
Specify user folder path#
n8n saves user-specific data like the encryption key, SQLite database file, and the ID of the tunnel (if used) in the subfolder .n8n of the user who started n8n. It's possible to overwrite the user-folder using an environment variable.
1
export N8N_USER_FOLDER=/home/jim/n8n



Refer to Environment variables reference for more information on this variable.
Configure n8n webhooks with reverse proxy#
n8n creates the webhook URL by combining N8N_PROTOCOL, N8N_HOST and N8N_PORT. If n8n runs behind a reverse proxy, that won't work. That's because n8n runs internally on port 5678 but the reverse proxy exposes it to the web on port 443. In that case, it's important to set the webhook URL manually so that n8n can display it in the Editor UI and register the correct webhook URLs with external services.
1
export WEBHOOK_URL=https://n8n.example.com/



Refer to Environment variables reference for more information on this variable.
Enable Prometheus metrics#
To collect and expose metrics, n8n uses the prom-client library.
The /metrics endpoint is disabled by default, but it's possible to enable it using the N8N_METRICS environment variable.
1
export N8N_METRICS=true



Refer to the respective Environment Variables (N8N_METRICS_INCLUDE_*) for configuring which metrics and labels should get exposed.
Both main and worker instances are able to expose metrics.
Queue metrics#
To enable queue metrics, set the N8N_METRICS_INCLUDE_QUEUE_METRICS env var to true. You can adjust the refresh rate with N8N_METRICS_QUEUE_METRICS_INTERVAL.
Queue metrics are only available for the main instance in single-main mode.

Required permissions#
n8n needs to create and modify the schemas of the tables it uses.
Recommended permissions:
1
2
3
CREATE DATABASE n8n-db;
CREATE USER n8n-user WITH PASSWORD 'random-password';
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON DATABASE n8n-db TO n8n-user;



TLS#
You can choose between these configurations:
Not declaring (default): Connect with SSL=off
Declaring only the CA and unauthorized flag: Connect with SSL=on and verify the server's signature
Declaring _{CERT,KEY} and the above: Use the certificate and key for client TLS authentication
SQLite#
This is the default database that gets used if nothing is defined.
The database file is located at: ~/.n8n/database.sqlite
Task runners#
Task runners are a generic mechanism to execute tasks in a secure and performant way. They're used to execute user-provided JavaScript code in the Code node.
This document describes how task runners work and how you can configure them.
How it works#
The task runner feature consists of three components: a task runner, a task broker, and a task requester.

Task runners connect to the task broker using a websocket connection. A task requester submits a task request to the broker where an available task runner can pick it up for execution.
The runner executes the task and submits the results to the task requester. The task broker coordinates communication between the runner and the requester.
The n8n instance (main and worker) acts as the broker. The Code node in this case is the task requester.
Task runner modes#
You can use task runners in two different modes: internal and external.
Internal mode#
In internal mode, the n8n instance launches the task runner as a child process. The n8n process monitors and manages the life cycle of the task runner. The task runner process shares the same uid and gid as n8n.
External mode#
In external mode, an external orchestrator (for example, Kubernetes) launches the task runner instead of n8n. Typically, this means you would configure the task runner to run as a side-car container next to n8n.

In this mode, the orchestrator monitors and manages the life cycle of the task runner container. The task runner is fully isolated from the n8n instance.
When using the Queue mode, each n8n container (main and workers) needs to have its own task runner.
Setting up external mode#
Use the following details to configure task runners in external mode
Configuring n8n instance in external mode#
You can configure n8n to use external task runners by setting the following environment variables:
Environment variables
Description
N8N_RUNNERS_ENABLED=true
Enables task runners.
N8N_RUNNERS_MODE=external
Use task runners in external mode.
N8N_RUNNERS_AUTH_TOKEN=<random secure shared secret>
A shared secret task runners use to connect to the broker.
N8N_RUNNERS_BROKER_LISTEN_ADDRESS=0.0.0.0
By default, the task broker only listens to localhost. When using multiple containers (for example, with Docker Compose), it needs to be able to accept external connections.

For full list of environment variables see task runner environment variables.
Configuring task runners in external mode#
The task runner comes bundled within the n8n Docker image. The Docker image also includes the task runner launcher.
The launcher can start the runner on-demand, which means lower memory usage when there's no work needed, but a short delay (few hundred ms) in cold-start. The launcher also monitors the runner and restarts it in case of infinite loops or other issues.
Run a task runner container from the n8n Docker image by setting the following properties:
Configuration
Description
command
["/usr/local/bin/task-runner-launcher", "javascript"]
livenessProbe
GET /healthz, port 5680

Set the following environment variables for the container, adjusted to fit your needs:
Environment variables
Description
N8N_RUNNERS_AUTH_TOKEN=<random secure shared secret>
The shared secret the task runner uses to connect to the broker.
N8N_RUNNERS_MAX_CONCURRENCY=5
The number of concurrent tasks the runner can execute.
N8N_RUNNERS_TASK_BROKER_URI=localhost:5679
The address of the task broker server within the n8n instance.
N8N_RUNNERS_AUTO_SHUTDOWN_TIMEOUT=15
Number of seconds of inactivity to wait before shutting down the task runner process. The launcher will automatically start the runner again when there are new tasks to execute. Set to 0 to disable automatic shutdown.
NODE_OPTIONS=--max-old-space-size=<limit>
The memory limit for the task runner Node.js process. This should be lower than the limit for container so that the runner runs out of memory before the container. That way, the launcher is able to monitor the runner.
GENERIC_TIMEZONE
The same default timezone as configured for the n8n instance.

For full list of environment variables see task runner environment variables.
Configure self-hosted n8n for user management#
User management in n8n allows you to invite people to work in your n8n instance.
This document describes how to configure your n8n instance to support user management, and the steps to start inviting users.
Refer to the main User management guide for more information about usage, including:
Managing users
Account types
Best practices
For LDAP setup information, refer to LDAP.
For SAML setup information, refer to SAML.
Basic auth and JWT removed
n8n removed support for basic auth and JWT in version 1.0.
Setup#
There are three stages to set up user management in n8n:
Configure your n8n instance to use your SMTP server.
Start n8n and follow the setup steps in the app.
Invite users.
Step one: SMTP#
n8n recommends setting up an SMTP server, for user invites and password resets.
Optional from 0.210.1
From version 0.210.1 onward, this step is optional. You can choose to manually copy and send invite links instead of setting up SMTP. Note that if you skip this step, users can't reset passwords.
Get the following information from your SMTP provider:
Server name
SMTP username
SMTP password
SMTP sender name
To set up SMTP with n8n, configure the SMTP environment variables for your n8n instance. For information on how to set environment variables, refer to Configuration

If your n8n instance is already running, you need to restart it to enable the new SMTP settings.
More configuration options
There are more configuration options available as environment variables. Refer to Environment variables for a list. These include options to disable tags, workflow templates, and the personalization survey, if you don't want your users to see them.
New to SMTP?
If you're not familiar with SMTP, this blog post by SendGrid offers a short introduction, while Wikipedia's Simple Mail Transfer Protocol article provides more detailed technical background.
Step two: In-app setup#
When you set up user management for the first time, you create an owner account.
Open n8n. The app displays a signup screen.
Enter your details. Your password must be at least eight characters, including at least one number and one capital letter.
Click Next. n8n logs you in with your new owner account.
Step three: Invite users#
You can now invite other people to your n8n instance.
Sign into your workspace with your owner account. (If you are in the Admin Panel open your Workspace from the Dashboard)
Click the three dots next to your user icon at the bottom left and click Settings. n8n opens your Personal settings page.
Click Users to go to the Users page.
Click Invite.
Enter the new user's email address.
Click Invite user. n8n sends an email with a link for the new user to join.
Logging in n8n#
Logging is an important feature for debugging. n8n uses the winston logging library.
Log streaming
n8n Self-hosted Enterprise tier includes Log streaming, in addition to the logging options described in this document.
Setup#
To set up logging in n8n, you need to set the following environment variables (you can also set the values in the configuration file)
Setting in the configuration file
Using environment variables
Description
n8n.log.level
N8N_LOG_LEVEL
The log output level. The available options are (from lowest to highest level) are error, warn, info, and debug. The default value is info. You can learn more about these options here.
n8n.log.output
N8N_LOG_OUTPUT
Where to output logs. The available options are console and file. Multiple values can be used separated by a comma (,). console is used by default.
n8n.log.file.location
N8N_LOG_FILE_LOCATION
The log file location, used only if log output is set to file. By default, <n8nFolderPath>/logs/n8n.log is used.
n8n.log.file.maxsize
N8N_LOG_FILE_SIZE_MAX
The maximum size (in MB) for each log file. By default, n8n uses 16 MB.
n8n.log.file.maxcount
N8N_LOG_FILE_COUNT_MAX
The maximum number of log files to keep. The default value is 100. This value should be set when using workers.

# Set log output to both console and a log file
export N8N_LOG_OUTPUT=console,file

# Set a save location for the log file
export N8N_LOG_FILE_LOCATION=/home/jim/n8n/logs/n8n.log

# Set a 50 MB maximum size for each log file
export N8N_LOG_FILE_MAXSIZE=50

# Set 60 as the maximum number of log files to be kept
export N8N_LOG_FILE_MAXCOUNT=60



Log levels#
n8n uses standard log levels to report:
silent: outputs nothing at all
error: outputs only errors and nothing else
warn: outputs errors and warning messages
info: contains useful information about progress
debug: the most verbose output. n8n outputs a lot of information to help you debug issues.
Development#
During development, adding log messages is a good practice. It assists in debugging errors. To configure logging for development, follow the guide below.
Implementation details#
n8n uses the LoggerProxy class, located in the workflow package. Calling the LoggerProxy.init() by passing in an instance of Logger, initializes the class before the usage.
The initialization process happens only once. The start.ts file already does this process for you. If you are creating a new command from scratch, you need to initialize the LoggerProxy class.
Once the Logger implementation gets created in the cli package, it can be obtained by calling the getInstance convenience method from the exported module.
Check the start.ts file to learn more about how this process works.
Adding logs#
Once the LoggerProxy class gets initialized in the project, you can import it to any other file and add logs.
Convenience methods are provided for all logging levels, so new logs can be added whenever needed using the format Logger.<logLevel>('<message>', ...meta), where meta represents any additional properties desired beyond message.
In the example above, we use the standard log levels described above. The message argument is a string, and meta is a data object.

// You have to import the LoggerProxy. We rename it to Logger to make it easier

import {
	LoggerProxy as Logger
} from 'n8n-workflow';

// Info-level logging of a trigger function, with workflow name and workflow ID as additional metadata properties

Logger.info(`Polling trigger initiated for workflow "${workflow.name}"`, {workflowName: workflow.name, workflowId: workflow.id});



When creating new loggers, some useful standards to keep in mind are:
Craft log messages to be as human-readable as possible. For example, always wrap names in quotes.
Duplicating information in the log message and metadata, like workflow name in the above example, can be useful as messages are easier to search and metadata enables easier filtering.
Include multiple IDs (for example, executionId, workflowId, and sessionId) throughout all logs.
Use node types instead of node names (or both) as this is more consistent, and so easier to search.
Front-end logs#
As of now, front-end logs aren't available. Using Logger or LoggerProxy would yield errors in the editor-ui package. This functionality will get implemented in the future versions.
Monitoring#
There are three API endpoints you can call to check the status of your instance: /healthz, healthz/readiness, and /metrics.
healthz and healthz/readiness#
The /healthz endpoint returns a standard HTTP status code. 200 indicates the instance is reachable. It doesn't indicate DB status. It's available for both self-hosted and Cloud users.
Access the endpoint:
1
<your-instance-url>/healthz



The /healthz/readiness endpoint is similar to the /healthz endpoint, but it returns a HTTP status code of 200 if the DB is connected and migrated and therefore the instance is ready to accept traffic.
Access the endpoint:
1
<your-instance-url>/healthz/readiness



metrics#
The /metrics endpoint provides more detailed information about the current status of the instance.
Access the endpoint:
1
<your-instance-url>/metrics



Feature availability
The /metrics endpoint isn't available on n8n Cloud.
Enable metrics and healthz for self-hosted n8n#
The /metrics and /healthz endpoints are disabled by default. To enable them, configure your n8n instance:
1
2
3
4
# metrics
N8N_METRICS=true
# healthz
QUEUE_HEALTH_CHECK_ACTIVE=true



Refer to Configuration methods for more information on how to configure your instance using environment variables.
Security audit#
You can run a security audit on your n8n instance, to detect common security issues.
Run an audit#
You can run an audit using the CLI, the public API, or the n8n node.
CLI#
Run n8n audit.
API#
Make a POST call to the /audit endpoint. You must authenticate as the instance owner.
n8n node#
Add the n8n node to your workflow. Select Resource > Audit and Operation > Generate.
Report contents#
The audit generates five risk reports:
Credentials#
This report shows:
Credentials not used in a workflow.
Credentials not used in an active workflow.
Credentials not use in a recently active workflow.
Database#
This report shows:
Expressions used in Execute Query fields in SQL nodes.
Expressions used in Query Parameters fields in SQL nodes.
Unused Query Parameters fields in SQL nodes.
File system#
This report lists nodes that interact with the file system.
Nodes#
This report shows:
Official risky nodes. These are n8n built in nodes. You can use them to fetch and run any code on the host system, which exposes the instance to exploits. You can view the list in n8n code | Audit constants, under OFFICIAL_RISKY_NODE_TYPES.
Community nodes.
Custom nodes.
Instance#
This report shows:
Unprotected webhooks in the instance.
Missing security settings
If your instance is outdated.
Disable the public REST API#
The n8n public REST API allows you to programmatically perform many of the same tasks as you can in the n8n GUI.
If you don't plan on using this API, n8n recommends disabling it to improve the security of your n8n installation.
To disable the public REST API, set the N8N_PUBLIC_API_DISABLED environment variable to true, for example:
1
export N8N_PUBLIC_API_DISABLED=true



Disable the API playground#
To disable the API playground, set the N8N_PUBLIC_API_SWAGGERUI_DISABLED environment variable to true, for example:
1
export N8N_PUBLIC_API_SWAGGERUI_DISABLED=true



Related resources#
Refer to Deployment environment variables for more information on these environment variables.
Refer to Configuration for more information on setting environment variables.
Data collection#
n8n collects some anonymous data from self-hosted n8n installations. Use the instructions below to opt out of data telemetry collection.
Collected data#
Refer to Privacy | Data collection in self-hosted n8n for details on the data n8n collects.
How collection works#
Your n8n instance sends most data to n8n as the events that generate it occur. Workflow execution counts and an instance pulse are sent periodically (every 6 hours). These data types mostly fall into n8n telemetry collection.
Opting out of data collection#
n8n enables telemetry collection by default. To disable it, configure the following environment variables.
Opt out of telemetry events#
To opt out of telemetry events, set the N8N_DIAGNOSTICS_ENABLED environment variable to false, for example:
1
export N8N_DIAGNOSTICS_ENABLED=false



Opt out of checking for new versions of n8n#
To opt out of checking for new versions of n8n, set the N8N_VERSION_NOTIFICATIONS_ENABLED environment variable to false, for example:
1
export N8N_VERSION_NOTIFICATIONS_ENABLED=false



Disable all connection to n8n servers#
If you want to fully prevent all communication with n8n's servers, refer to Isolate n8n.
Related resources#
Refer to Deployment environment variables for more information on these environment variables.
Refer to Configuration for more information on setting environment variables.
Block access to nodes#
For security reasons, you may want to block your users from accessing or working with specific n8n nodes. This is helpful if your users might be untrustworthy.
Use the NODES_EXCLUDE environment variable to prevent your users from accessing specific nodes.
Exclude nodes#
Update your NODES_EXCLUDE environment variable to include an array of strings containing any nodes you want to block your users from using.
For example, setting the variable this way:
1
NODES_EXCLUDE: "[\"n8n-nodes-base.executeCommand\", \"n8n-nodes-base.readWriteFile\"]"



Blocks the Execute Command and Read/Write Files from Disk nodes.
Your n8n users won't be able to search for or use these nodes.
Suggested nodes to block#
The nodes that can pose security risks vary based on your use case and user profile. Here are some nodes you might want to start with:
Execute Command
Read/Write Files from Disk
Related resources#
Refer to Nodes environment variables for more information on this environment variable.
Refer to Configuration for more information on setting environment variables.
Hardening task runners#
Task runners are responsible for executing code from the Code node. While Code node executions are secure, you can follow these recommendations to further harden your task runners.
Run task runners as sidecars in external mode#
To increase the isolation between the core n8n process and code in the Code node, run task runners in external mode. External task runners launch as separate containers, providing a fully isolated environment to execute the JavaScript defined in the Code node.

Architecture#
Understanding n8n's underlying architecture is helpful if you need to:
Embed n8n
Customize n8n's default databases
This section is a work in progress. If you have questions, please try the forum and let n8n know which architecture documents would be useful for you.
Database structure#
This page describes the purpose of each table in the n8n database.
Database and query technology#
By default, n8n uses SQLite as the database. If you are using another database the structure will be similar, but the data-types may be different depending on the database.
n8n uses TypeORM for queries and migrations.
To inspect the n8n database, you can use DBeaver, which is an open-source universal database tool.
Tables#
These are the tables n8n creates during setup.
auth_identity#
Stores details of external authentication providers when using SAML.

Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD)#

CLI commands for n8n#
n8n includes a CLI (command line interface), allowing you to perform actions using the CLI rather than the n8n editor. These include starting workflows, and exporting and importing workflows and credentials.
Running CLI commands#
You can use CLI commands with self-hosted n8n. Depending on how you choose to install n8n, there are differences in how to run the commands:
npm: the n8n command is directly available. The documentation uses this in the examples below.
Docker: the n8n command is available within your Docker container:
1
docker exec -u node -it <n8n-container-name> <n8n-cli-command>



Start a workflow#
You can start workflows directly using the CLI.
Execute a saved workflow by its ID:
1
n8n execute --id <ID>



Change the active status of a workflow#
You can change the active status of a workflow using the CLI.
Restart required
These commands operate on your n8n database. If you execute them while n8n is running, the changes don't take effect until you restart n8n.
Set the active status of a workflow by its ID to false:
1
n8n update:workflow --id=<ID> --active=false



Set the active status of a workflow by its ID to true:
1
n8n update:workflow --id=<ID> --active=true



Set the active status to false for all the workflows:
1
n8n update:workflow --all --active=false



Set the active status to true for all the workflows:
1
n8n update:workflow --all --active=true



Export workflows and credentials#
You can export your workflows and credentials from n8n using the CLI.
Command flags:
Flag
Description
--help
Help prompt.
--all
Exports all workflows/credentials.
--backup
Sets --all --pretty --separate for backups. You can optionally set --output.
--id
The ID of the workflow to export.
--output
Outputs file name or directory if using separate files.
--pretty
Formats the output in an easier to read fashion.
--separate
Exports one file per workflow (useful for versioning). Must set a directory using --output.
--decrypted
Exports the credentials in a plain text format.

Workflows#
Export all your workflows to the standard output (terminal):
1
n8n export:workflow --all



Export a workflow by its ID and specify the output file name:
1
n8n export:workflow --id=<ID> --output=file.json



Export all workflows to a specific directory in a single file:
1
n8n export:workflow --all --output=backups/latest/file.json



Export all the workflows to a specific directory using the --backup flag (details above):
1
n8n export:workflow --backup --output=backups/latest/



Credentials#
Export all your credentials to the standard output (terminal):
1
n8n export:credentials --all



Export credentials by their ID and specify the output file name:
1
n8n export:credentials --id=<ID> --output=file.json



Export all credentials to a specific directory in a single file:
1
n8n export:credentials --all --output=backups/latest/file.json



Export all the credentials to a specific directory using the --backup flag (details above):
1
n8n export:credentials --backup --output=backups/latest/



Export all the credentials in plain text format. You can use this to migrate from one installation to another that has a different secret key in the configuration file.
Sensitive information
All sensitive information is visible in the files.
1
n8n export:credentials --all --decrypted --output=backups/decrypted.json



Import workflows and credentials#
You can import your workflows and credentials from n8n using the CLI.
Update the IDs
When exporting workflows and credentials, n8n also exports their IDs. If you have workflows and credentials with the same IDs in your existing database, they will be overwritten. To avoid this, delete or change the IDs before importing.
Available flags:
Flag
Description
--help
Help prompt.
--input
Input file name or directory if you use --separate.
--projectId
Import the workflow or credential to the specified project. Can't be used with --userId.
--separate
Imports *.json files from directory provided by --input.
--userId
Import the workflow or credential to the specified user. Can't be used with --projectId.

Migrating to SQLite
n8n limits workflow and credential names to 128 characters, but SQLite doesn't enforce size limits.
This might result in errors like Data too long for column name during the import process.
In this case, you can edit the names from the n8n interface and export again, or edit the JSON file directly before importing.
Workflows#
Import workflows from a specific file:
1
n8n import:workflow --input=file.json



Import all the workflow files as JSON from the specified directory:
1
n8n import:workflow --separate --input=backups/latest/



Credentials#
Import credentials from a specific file:
1
n8n import:credentials --input=file.json



Import all the credentials files as JSON from the specified directory:
1
n8n import:credentials --separate --input=backups/latest/



License#
Clear#
Clear your existing license from n8n's database and reset n8n to default features:
1
n8n license:clear



If your license includes floating entitlements, running this command will also attempt to release them back to the pool, making them available for other instances.
Info#
Display information about the existing license:
1
n8n license:info



User management#
You can reset user management using the n8n CLI. This returns user management to its pre-setup state. It removes all user accounts.
Use this if you forget your password, and don't have SMTP set up to do password resets by email.
1
n8n user-management:reset



Disable MFA for a user#
If a user loses their recovery codes you can disable MFA for a user with this command. The user will then be able to log back in to set up MFA again.
1
n8n mfa:disable --email=johndoe@example.com



Disable LDAP#
You can reset the LDAP settings using the command below.
1
n8n ldap:reset



Uninstall community nodes and credentials#
You can manage community nodes using the n8n CLI. For now, you can only uninstall community nodes and credentials, which is useful if a community node causes instability.
Command flags:
Flag
Description
--help
Show CLI help.
--credential
The credential type. Get this value by visiting the node's <NODE>.credential.ts file and getting the value of name.
--package
Package name of the community node.
--uninstall
Uninstalls the node.
--userId
The ID of the user who owns the credential. On self-hosted, query the database. On cloud, query the API with your API key.

Nodes#
Uninstall a community node by package name:
1
n8n community-node --uninstall --package <COMMUNITY_NODE_NAME>



For example, to uninstall the Evolution API community node, type:
1
n8n community-node --uninstall --package n8n-nodes-evolution-api



Credentials#
Uninstall a community node credential:
1
n8n community-node --uninstall --credential <CREDENTIAL_TYPE> --userId <ID>



For example, to uninstall the Evolution API community node credential, visit the repository and navigate to the credentials.ts file to find the name:
1
n8n community-node --uninstall --credential evolutionApi --userId 1234



Security audit#
You can run a security audit on your n8n instance, to detect common security issues.
1
n8n audit


Install and manage community nodes#
There are three ways to install community nodes:
Within n8n using the nodes panel (for verified community nodes only).
Within n8n using the GUI: Use this method to install community nodes from the npm registry.
Manually from the command line: use this method to install community nodes from npm if your n8n instance doesn't support installation through the in-app GUI.
Installing from npm only available on self-hosted instances
Unverified community nodes aren't available on n8n cloud and require self-hosting n8n.
Install verified community nodes in the n8n app#
Limited to n8n instance owners
Only the n8n instance owner can install and manage verified community nodes. The instance owner is the person who sets up and manages user management. All members of an n8n instance can use already installed community nodes in their workflows.
Admin accounts can also uninstall any community node, verified or unverified. This helps them remove problematic nodes that may affect the instance's health and functionality.
Install a community node#
To install a verified community node:
Go to the Canvas and open the nodes panel (either by selecting '+' or pressing Tab).
Search for the node that you're looking for. If there is a matching verified community node, you will see a More from the community section at the bottom of the nodes panel.
Select the node you want to install. This takes you to a detailed view of the node, showing all the supported actions.
Select install. This will install the node for your instance and enable all members to use it in their workflows.
You can now add the node to your workflows.
Enable installation of verified community nodes
Some users may not want to show verified community nodes in the nodes panel of their instances. On n8n cloud, instance owners can toggle this in the Cloud Admin Panel. Self-hosted users can use environment variables to control the availability of this feature.
Uninstall a community node#
To uninstall a community node:
Go to Settings > Community nodes.
On the node you want to install, select Options .
Select Uninstall package.
Select Uninstall Package in the confirmation modal.
Install community nodes from npm in the n8n app#
Only for instance owners of self-hosted n8n instances
Only the n8n instance owner of a self-hosted n8n instance can install and manage community nodes from npm. The instance owner is the person who sets up and manages user management.
Admin accounts can also uninstall any community node, verified or unverified. This helps them remove problematic nodes that may affect the instance's health and functionality.
Install a community node#
To install a community node from npm:
Go to Settings > Community Nodes.
Select Install.
Find the node you want to install:
Select Browse. n8n takes you to an npm search results page, showing all npm packages tagged with the keyword n8n-community-node-package.
Browse the list of results. You can filter the results or add more keywords.
Once you find the package you want, make a note of the package name. If you want to install a specific version, make a note of the version number as well.
Return to n8n.
Enter the npm package name, and version number if required. For example, consider a community node designed to access a weather API called "Storms." The package name is n8n-node-storms, and it has three major versions.
To install the latest version of a package called n8n-node-weather: enter n8n-nodes-storms in Enter npm package name.
To install version 2.3: enter n8n-node-storms@2.3 in Enter npm package name.
Agree to the risks of using community nodes: select I understand the risks of installing unverified code from a public source.
Select Install. n8n installs the node, and returns to the Community Nodes list in Settings.
Nodes on the blocklist
n8n maintains a blocklist of community nodes that it prevents you from installing. Refer to n8n community node blocklist for more information.
Uninstall a community node#
To uninstall a community node:
Go to Settings > Community nodes.
On the node you want to install, select Options .
Select Uninstall package.
Select Uninstall Package in the confirmation modal.
Upgrade a community node#
Breaking changes in versions
Node developers may introduce breaking changes in new versions of their nodes. A breaking change is an update that breaks previous functionality. Depending on the node versioning approach that a node developer chooses, upgrading to a version with a breaking change could cause all workflows using the node to break. Be careful when upgrading your nodes. If you find that an upgrade causes issues, you can downgrade.
Upgrade to the latest version#
You can upgrade community nodes to the latest version from the node list in Settings > community nodes.
When a new version of a community node is available, n8n displays an Update button on the node. Click the button to upgrade to the latest version.
Upgrade to a specific version#
To upgrade to a specific version (a version other than the latest), uninstall the node, then reinstall it, making sure to specify the target version. Follow the Installation instructions for more guidance.
Downgrade a community node#
If there is a problem with a particular version of a community node, you may want to roll back to a previous version.
To do this, uninstall the community node, then reinstall it, targeting a specific node version. Follow the Installation instructions for more guidance.
Manually install community nodes from npm#
You can manually install community nodes from the npm registry on self-hosted n8n.
You need to manually install community nodes in the following circumstances:
Your n8n instance runs in queue mode.
You want to install private packages.
Install a community node#
Access your Docker shell:
1
docker exec -it n8n sh



Create ~/.n8n/nodes if it doesn't already exist, and navigate into it:
1
2
mkdir ~/.n8n/nodes
cd ~/.n8n/nodes



Install the node:
1
npm i n8n-nodes-nodeName



Then restart n8n.
Uninstall a community node#
Access your Docker shell:
1
docker exec -it n8n sh



Run npm uninstall:
1
npm uninstall n8n-nodes-nodeName



Upgrade a community node#
Breaking changes in versions
Node developers may introduce breaking changes in new versions of their nodes. A breaking change is an update that breaks previous functionality. Depending on the node versioning approach that a node developer chooses, upgrading to a version with a breaking change could cause all workflows using the node to break. Be careful when upgrading your nodes. If you find that an upgrade causes issues, you can downgrade.
Upgrade to the latest version#
Access your Docker shell:
1
docker exec -it n8n sh



Run npm update:
1
npm update n8n-nodes-nodeName



Upgrade or downgrade to a specific version#
Access your Docker shell:
1
docker exec -it n8n sh



Run npm uninstall to remove the current version:
1
npm uninstall n8n-nodes-nodeName



Run npm install with the version specified:
1
2
# Replace 2.1.0 with your version number
npm install n8n-nodes-nodeName@2.1.0

Risks when using community nodes#
Installing community nodes from npm means you are installing unverified code from a public source into your n8n instance. This has some risks.
Risks include:
System security: community nodes have full access to the machine that n8n runs on, and can do anything, including malicious actions.
Data security: any community node that you use has access to data in your workflows.
Breaking changes: node developers may introduce breaking changes in new versions of their nodes. A breaking change is an update that breaks previous functionality. Depending on the node versioning approach that a node developer chooses, upgrading to a version with a breaking change could cause all workflows using the node to break. Be careful when upgrading your nodes.
n8n vets verified community nodes
In addition to publicly available community nodes from npm, n8n inspects some nodes and makes them available as verified community node inside the nodes panel. These nodes have to meet a set of data and system security requirements for approval.
Report bad community nodes#
You can report bad community nodes to security@n8n.io
Disable community nodes#
If you are self-hosting n8n, you can disable community nodes by setting N8N_COMMUNITY_PACKAGES_ENABLED to false. On n8n cloud, visit the Cloud Admin Panel and disable community nodes from there. See troubleshooting for more information.
n8n community node blocklist#
n8n maintains a blocklist of community nodes. You can't install any node on this list.
n8n may add community nodes to the blocklist for a range of reasons, including:
The node is intentionally malicious
It's low quality (low enough to be harmful)
If you are a community node creator whose node is on the blocklist, and you believe this is a mistake, contact hello@n8n.io.
Using community nodes#
To use community nodes, you first need to install them.
Adding community nodes to your workflow#
After installing a community node, you can use it like any other node. n8n displays the node in search results in the Nodes panel. n8n marks community nodes with a Package  icon in the nodes panel.
Community nodes with duplicate names#
It's possible for several community nodes to have the same name. If you use two nodes with the same name in your workflow, they'll look the same, unless they have different icons.
Troubleshooting and errors#
Error: Missing packages#
n8n installs community nodes directly onto the hard disk. The files must be available at startup for n8n to load them. If the packages aren't available at startup, you get an error warning of missing packages.
If running n8n using Docker: depending on your Docker setup, you may lose the packages when you recreate your container or upgrade your n8n version. You must either:
Persist the contents of the ~/.n8n/nodes directory. This is the best option. If you follow the Docker installation guide, the setup steps include persisting this directory.
Set the N8N_REINSTALL_MISSING_PACKAGES environment variable to true.
The second option might increase startup time and may cause health checks to fail.
Prevent loading community nodes on n8n cloud#
If your n8n cloud instance crashes and fails to start, you can prevent installed community nodes from loading on instance startup. Visit the Cloud Admin Panel > Manage and toggle Disable all community nodes to true. This toggle is only visible when you allow community node installation.
Building community nodes#
Subject to change
The standards described in this document are for the first release of the community nodes repository. These may change in future releases.
Community nodes are npm packages, hosted in the npm registry.
When building a node to submit to the community node repository, use the following resources to make sure your node setup is correct:
View the starter node and n8n's own nodes for some examples.
Refer to the documentation on building your own nodes.
Make sure your node follows the standards for community nodes.
Standards#
To make your node available to the n8n community node repository, you must:
Make sure the package name starts with n8n-nodes- or @<scope>/n8n-nodes-. For example, n8n-nodes-weather or @weatherPlugins/n8n-nodes-weather.
Include n8n-community-node-package in your package keywords.
Make sure that you add your nodes and credentials to the package.json file inside the n8n attribute. Refer to the package.json in the starter node for an example.
Check your node using the linter and test it locally to ensure it works.
Submit the package to the npm registry. Refer to npm's documentation on Contributing packages to the registry for more information.
Submit your node for verification by n8n#
n8n vets verified community nodes. Users can discover and install verified community nodes from the nodes panel in n8n. These nodes need to adhere to certain technical and UX standards and constraints.
Before submitting your node for review by n8n, you must:
Make sure that your node follows the technical guidelines for verified community nodes and that all automated checks pass. Specifically, verified community nodes aren't allowed to use any run-time dependencies.
Ensure that your node follows the UX guidelines.
Make sure that the node has appropriate documentation in the form of a README in the npm package or a related public repository.
Submit your node to npm as n8n will fetch it from there for final vetting.
If your node meets all the above requirements, click here to submit your node for verification.
Creating nodes#
Learn how to build your own custom nodes.
This section includes:
Guidance on planning your build, including which style to use.
Tutorials for different node building styles.
Instructions for testing your node, including how to use the n8n node linter and troubleshooting support.
How to share your node with the community, submit it for verification by n8n, or use it as a private node.
Reference material, including UI elements and information on the individual files that make up a node.
Prerequisites#
This section assumes the following:
Some familiarity with JavaScript and TypeScript.
Ability to manage your own development environment, including git.
Knowledge of npm, including creating and submitting packages.
Familiarity with n8n, including a good understanding of data structures and item linking.
Plan a node#
This section provides guidance on designing your node, including key technical decisions such as choosing your node building style.
When building a node, there are design choices you need to make before you start:
Which node type you need to build.
Which node building style to use.
Your UI design and UX principles
Your node's file structure.
Node types: Trigger and Action#
There are two node types you can build for n8n: trigger nodes and action nodes.
Both types provide integrations with external services.
Trigger nodes#
Trigger nodes start a workflow and supply the initial data. A workflow can contain multiple trigger nodes but with each execution, only one of them will execute, depending on the triggering event.
There are three types of trigger nodes in n8n:
Type
Description
Example Nodes
Webhook
Nodes for services that support webhooks. These nodes listen for events and trigger workflows in real time.
Zendesk Trigger, Telegram Trigger, Brevo Trigger
Polling
Nodes for services that don't support webhooks. These nodes periodically check for new data, triggering workflows when they detect updates.
Airtable Trigger, Gmail Trigger, Google Sheet Trigger, RssFeed Read Trigger
Others
Nodes that handle real-time responses not related to HTTP requests or polling. This includes message queue nodes and time-based triggers.
AMQP Trigger, RabbitMQ Trigger, MQTT Trigger, Schedule Trigger, Email Trigger (IMAP)

Action nodes#
Action nodes perform operations as part of your workflow. These can include manipulating data, and triggering events in other systems.
Choose your node building approach#
n8n has two node-building styles, declarative and programmatic.
You should use the declarative style for most nodes. This style:
Uses a JSON-based syntax, making it simpler to write, with less risk of introducing bugs.
Is more future-proof.
Supports integration with REST APIs.
The programmatic style is more verbose. You must use the programmatic style for:
Trigger nodes
Any node that isn't REST-based. This includes nodes that need to call a GraphQL API and nodes that use external dependencies.
Any node that needs to transform incoming data.
Full versioning. Refer to Node versioning for more information on types of versioning.
Data handling differences#
The main difference between the declarative and programmatic styles is how they handle incoming data and build API requests. The programmatic style requires an execute() method, which reads incoming data and parameters, then builds a request. The declarative style handles this using the routing key in the operations object. Refer to Node base file for more information on node parameters and the execute() method.
Syntax differences#
To understand the difference between the declarative and programmatic styles, compare the two code snippets below. This example creates a simplified version of the SendGrid integration, called "FriendGrid." The following code snippets aren't complete: they emphasize the differences in the node building styles.

Design your node's user interface#
Most nodes are a GUI (graphical user interface) representation of an API. Designing the interface means finding a user-friendly way to represent API endpoints and parameters. Directly translating an entire API into form fields in a node may not result in a good user experience.
This document provides design guidance and standards to follow. These guidelines are the same as those used by n8n. This helps provide a smooth and consistent user experience for users mixing community and built-in nodes.
Design guidance#
All node's use n8n's node UI elements, so you don't need to consider style details such as colors, borders, and so on. However, it's still useful to go through a basic design process:
Review the documentation for the API you're integrating. Ask yourself:
What can you leave out?
What can you simplify?
Which parts of the API are confusing? How can you help users understand them?
Use a wireframe tool to try out your field layout. If you find your node has a lot of fields and is getting confusing, consider n8n's guidance on showing and hiding fields.
Standards#
UI text style#
Element
Style
Drop-down value
Title case
Hint
Sentence case
Info box
Sentence case. Don't use a period (.) for one-sentence information. Always use a period if there's more than one sentence. This field can include links, which should open in a new tab.
Node name
Title case
Parameter name
Title case
Subtitle
Title case
Tooltip
Sentence case. Don't use a period (.) for one-sentence tooltips. Always use a period if there's more than one sentence. This field can include links, which should open in a new tab.

UI text terminology#
Use the same terminology as the service the node connects to. For example, a Notion node should refer to Notion blocks, not Notion paragraphs, because Notion calls these elements blocks. There are exceptions to this rule, usually to avoid technical terms (for example, refer to the guidance on name and description for upsert operations).
Sometimes a service has different terms for something in its API and in its GUI. Use the GUI language in your node, as this is what most users are familiar with. If you think some users may need to refer to the service's API docs, consider including this information in a hint.
Don't use technical jargon when there are simpler alternatives.
Be consistent when naming things. For example, choose one of directory or folder then stick to it.
Node naming conventions#
Convention
Correct
Incorrect
If a node is a trigger node,
the displayed name should have 'Trigger' at the end,
with a space before.
Shopify Trigger
ShopifyTrigger, Shopify trigger
Don't include 'node' in the name.
Asana
Asana Node, Asana node

Showing and hiding fields#
Fields can either be:
Displayed when the node opens: use this for resources and operations, and required fields.
Hidden in the Optional fields section until a user clicks on that section: use this for optional fields.
Progressively disclose complexity: hide a field until any earlier fields it depends on have values. For example, if you have a Filter by date toggle, and a Date to filter by datepicker, don't display Date to filter by until the user enables Filter by date.
Conventions by field type#
Credentials#
n8n automatically displays credential fields as the top fields in the node.
Resources and operations#
APIs usually involve doing something to data. For example, "get all tasks." In this example, "task" is the resource, and "get all" is the operation.
When your node has this resource and operation pattern, your first field should be Resource, and your second field should be Operation.
Required fields#
Order fields by:
Most important to least important.
Scope: from broad to narrow. For example, you have fields for Document, Page, and Text to insert, put them in that order.
Optional fields#
Order fields alphabetically. To group similar things together, you can rename them. For example, rename Email and Secondary Email to Email (primary) and Email (secondary).
If an optional field has a default value that the node uses when the value isn't set, load the field with that value. Explain this in the field description. For example, Defaults to false.
Connected fields: if one optional fields is dependent on another, bundle them together. They should both be under a single option that shows both fields when selected.
If you have a lot of optional fields, consider grouping them by theme.
Help#
There are five types of help built in to the GUI:
Info boxes: yellow boxes that appear between fields. Refer to UI elements | Notice for more information.
Use info boxes for essential information. Don't over-use them. By making them rare, they stand out more and grab the user's attention.
Parameter hints: lines of text displayed beneath a user input field. Use this when there's something the user needs to know, but an info box would be excessive.
Node hints: provide help in the input panel, output panel, or node details view. Refer to UI elements | Hints for more information.
Tooltips: callouts that appear when the user hovers over the tooltip icon . Use tooltips for extra information that the user might need.
You don't have to provide a tooltip for every field. Only add one if it contains useful information.
When writing tooltips, think about what the user needs. Don't just copy-paste API parameter descriptions. If the description doesn't make sense, or has errors, improve it.
Placeholder text: n8n can display placeholder text in a field where the user hasn't entered a value. This can help the user know what's expected in that field.
Info boxes, hints, and tooltips can contain links to more information.
Errors#
Make it clear which fields are required.
Add validation rules to fields if possible. For example, check for valid email patterns if the field expects an email.
When displaying errors, make sure only the main error message displays in the red error title. More information should go in Details.
Toggles#
Tooltips for binary states should start with something like Whether to . . . .
You may need a list rather than a toggle:
Use toggles when it's clear what happens in a false state. For example, Simplify Output?. The alternative (don't simplify output) is clear.
Use a dropdown list with named options when you need more clarity. For example, Append?. What happens if you don't append is unclear (it could be that nothing happens, or information is overwritten, or discarded).
Lists#
Set default values for lists whenever possible. The default should be the most-used option.
Sort list options alphabetically.
You can include list option descriptions. Only add descriptions if they provide useful information.
If there is an option like All, use the word All, not shorthand like *.
Trigger node inputs#
When a trigger node has a parameter for specifying which events to trigger on:
Name the parameter Trigger on.
Don't include a tooltip.
Subtitles#
Set subtitles based on the values of the main parameters. For example:
1
subtitle: '={{$parameter["operation"] + ": " + $parameter["resource"]}}',



IDs#
When performing an operation on a specific record, such as "update a task comment" you need a way to specify which record you want to change.
Wherever possible, provide two ways to specify a record:
By choosing from a pre-populated list. You can generate this list using the loadOptions parameter. Refer to Base files for more information.
By entering an ID.
Name the field <Record name> name or ID. For example, Workspace Name or ID. Add a tooltip saying "Choose a name from the list, or specify an ID using an expression." Link to n8n's Expressions documentation.
Build your node so that it can handle users providing more information than required. For example:
If you need a relative path, handle the user pasting in the absolute path.
If the user needs to get an ID from a URL, handle the user pasting in the entire URL.
Dates and timestamps#
n8n uses ISO timestamp strings for dates and times. Make sure that any date or timestamp field you add supports all ISO 8601 formats.
JSON#
You should support two ways of specifying the content of a text input that expects JSON:
Typing JSON directly into the text input: you need to parse the resulting string into a JSON object.
Using an expression that returns JSON.
Node icons#
Common patterns and exceptions#
This section provides guidance on handling common design patterns, including some edge cases and exceptions to the main standards.
Simplify responses#
APIs can return a lot of data that isn't useful. Consider adding a toggle that allows users to choose to simplify the response data:
Name: Simplify Response
Description: Whether to return a simplified version of the response instead of the raw data
Upsert operations#
This should always be a separate operation with:
Name: Create or Update
Description: Create a new record, or update the current one if it already exists (upsert)
Boolean operators#
n8n doesn't have good support for combining boolean operators, such as AND and OR, in the GUI. Whenever possible, provide options for all ANDs or all ORs.
For example, you have a field called Must match to test if values match. Include options to test for Any and All, as separate options.
Source keys or binary properties#
Binary data is file data, such as spreadsheets or images. In n8n, you need a named key to reference the data. Don't use the terms "binary data" or "binary property" for this field. Instead, use a more descriptive name: Input data field name / Output data field name.
Node file structure#
Following best practices and standards in your node structure makes your node easier to maintain. It's helpful if other people need to work with the code.
The file and directory structure of your node depends on:
Your node's complexity.
Whether you use node versioning.
How many nodes you include in the npm package.
Required files and directories#
Your node must include:
A package.json file at the root of the project. This is required for any npm module.
A nodes directory, containing the code for your node:
This directory must contain the base file, in the format <node-name>.node.ts. For example, MyNode.node.ts.
n8n recommends including a codex file, containing metadata for your node. The codex filename must match the node base filename. For example, given a node base file named MyNode.node.ts, the codex name is MyNode.node.json.
The nodes directory can contain other files and subdirectories, including directories for versions, and node code split across more than one file to create a modular structure.
A credentials directory, containing your credentials code. This code lives in a single credentials file. The filename format is <node-name>.credentials.ts. For example, MyNode.credentials.ts.
Modular structure#
You can choose whether to place all your node's functionality in one file, or split it out into a base file and other modules, which the base file then imports. Unless your node is very simple, it's a best practice to split it out.
A basic pattern is to separate out operations. Refer to the HttpBin starter node for an example of this.
For more complex nodes, n8n recommends a directory structure. Refer to the Airtable node or Microsoft Outlook node as examples.
actions: a directory containing sub-directories that represent resources.
Each sub-directory should contain two types of files:
An index file with resource description (named either <resourceName>.resource.ts or index.ts)
Files for operations <operationName>.operation.ts. These files should have two exports: description of the operation and an execute function.
methods: an optional directory dynamic parameters' functions.
transport: a directory containing the communication implementation.
Versioning#
If your node has more than one version, and you're using full versioning, this makes the file structure more complex. You need a directory for each version, along with a base file that sets the default version. Refer to Node versioning for more information on working with versions, including types of versioning.
Decide how many nodes to include in a package#
There are two possible setups when building a node:
One node in one npm package.
More than one node in a single npm package.
n8n supports both approaches. If you include more than one node, each node should have its own directory in the nodes directory.
A best-practice example for programmatic nodes#
n8n's built-in Airtable node implements a modular structure and versioning, following recommended patterns.
Node base file#
The node base file contains the core code of your node. All nodes must have a base file. The contents of this file are different depending on whether you're building a declarative-style or programmatic-style node. For guidance on which style to use, refer to Choose your node building approach.
These documents give short code snippets to help understand the code structure and concepts. For full walk-throughs of building a node, including real-world code examples, refer to Build a declarative-style node or Build a programmatic-style node.
You can also explore the n8n-nodes-starter and n8n's own nodes for a wider range of examples. The starter contains basic examples that you can build on. The n8n Mattermost node is a good example of a more complex programmatic-style node, including versioning.
For all nodes, refer to the:
Structure of the node base file
Standard parameters
For declarative-style nodes, refer to the:
Declarative-style parameters
For programmatic-style nodes, refer to the:
Programmatic-style parameters
Programmatic-style execute() method
Structure of the node base file#
The node base file follows this basic structure:
Add import statements.
Create a class for the node.
Within the node class, create a description object, which defines the node.
A programmatic-style node also has an execute() method, which reads incoming data and parameters, then builds a request. The declarative style handles this using the routing key in the properties object, within descriptions.

};



Refer to Standard parameters for information on parameters available to all node types. Refer to Programmatic-style parameters and Programmatic-style execute method for more information on working with programmatic-style nodes.
Standard parameters#
These are the standard parameters for the node base file. They're the same for all node types.
displayName#
String | Required
This is the name users see in the n8n GUI.
name#
String | Required
The internal name of the object. Used to reference it from other places in the node.
icon#
String or Object | Required
Specifies an icon for a particular node. n8n recommends uploading your own image file.
You can provide the icon file name as a string, or as an object to handle different icons for light and dark modes. If the icon works in both light and dark modes, use a string that starts with file:, indicating the path to the icon file. For example:
1
icon: 'file:exampleNodeIcon.svg'



To provide different icons for light and dark modes, use an object with light and dark properties. For example:
1
2
3
4
icon: { 
  light: 'file:exampleNodeIcon.svg', 
  dark: 'file:exampleNodeIcon.dark.svg' 
}



n8n recommends using an SVG for your node icon, but you can also use PNG. If using PNG, the icon resolution should be 60x60px. Node icons should have a square or near-square aspect ratio.
Don't reference Font Awesome
If you want to use a Font Awesome icon in your node, download and embed the image.
group#
Array of strings | Required
Tells n8n how the node behaves when the workflow runs. Options are:
trigger: node waits for a trigger.
schedule: node waits for a timer to expire.
input, output, transform: these currently have no effect.
An empty array, []. Use this as the default option if you don't need trigger or schedule.
description#
String | Required
A short description of the node. n8n uses this in the GUI.
defaults#
Object | Required
Contains essential brand and name settings.
The object can include:
name: String. Used as the node name on the canvas if the displayName is too long.
color: String. Hex color code. Provide the brand color of the integration for use in n8n.
forceInputNodeExecution#
Boolean | Optional
When building a multi-input node, you can choose to force all preceding nodes on all branches to execute before the node runs. The default is false (requiring only one input branch to run).
inputs#
Array of strings | Required
Names the input connectors. Controls the number of connectors the node has on the input side. If you need only one connector, use input: ['main'].
outputs#
Array of strings | Required
Names the output connectors. Controls the number of connectors the node has on the output side. If you need only one connector, use output: ['main'].
requiredInputs#
Integer or Array | Optional
Used for multi-input nodes. Specify inputs by number that must have data (their branches must run) before the node can execute.
credentials#
Array of objects | Required
This parameter tells n8n the credential options. Each object defines an authentication type.
The object must include:
name: the credential name. Must match the name property in the credential file. For example, name: 'asanaApi' in Asana.node.ts links to name = 'asanaApi' in AsanaApi.credential.ts.
required: Boolean. Specify whether authentication is required to use this node.
requestDefaults#
Object | Required
Set up the basic information for the API calls the node makes.
This object must include:
baseURL: The API base URL.
You can also add:
headers: an object describing the API call headers, such as content type.
url: string. Appended to the baseURL. You can usually leave this out. It's more common to provide this in the operations.
properties#
Array of objects | Required
This contains the resource and operations objects that define node behaviors, as well as objects to set up mandatory and optional fields that can receive user input.
Resource objects#
A resource object includes the following parameters:
displayName: String. This should always be Resource.
name: String. This should always be resource.
type: String. Tells n8n which UI element to use, and what input type to expect. For example, options results in n8n adding a dropdown that allows users to choose one option. Refer to Node UI elements for more information.
noDataExpression: Boolean. Prevents using an expression for the parameter. Must always be true for resource.
Operations objects#
The operations object defines the available operations on a resource.
displayName: String. This should always be Options.
name: String. This should always be option.
type: String. Tells n8n which UI element to use, and what input type to expect. For example, dateTime results in n8n adding a date picker. Refer to Node UI elements for more information.
noDataExpression: Boolean. Prevents using an expression for the parameter. Must always be true for operation.
options: Array of objects. Each objects describes an operation's behavior, such as its routing, the REST verb it uses, and so on. An options object includes:
name. String.
value. String.
action: String. This parameter combines the resource and operation. You should always include it, as n8n will use it in future versions. For example, given a resource called "Card" and an operation "Get all", your action is "Get all cards".
description: String.
routing: Object containing request details.
Additional fields objects#
These objects define optional parameters. n8n displays them under Additional Fields in the GUI. Users can choose which parameters to set.
The objects must include:

  show: {
    resource: [
      // Resource names
    ],
    operation: [
      // Operation names
    ]
  },
}



For more information about UI element types, refer to UI elements.
Declarative-style parameters#
These are the parameters available for node base file of declarative-style nodes.
This document gives short code snippets to help understand the code structure and concepts. For a full walk-through of building a node, including real-world code examples, refer to Build a declarative-style node.
Refer to Standard parameters for parameters available to all nodes.
methods and loadOptions#
Object | Optional
methods contains the loadOptions object. You can use loadOptions to query the service to get user-specific settings, then return them and render them in the GUI so the user can include them in subsequent queries. The object must include routing information for how to query the service, and output settings that define how to handle the returned options. For example:

						},
					},
				],
			},
		},
	}
},



routing#
Object | Required
routing is an object used within an options array in operations and input field objects. It contains the details of an API call.
The code example below comes from the Declarative-style tutorial. It sets up an integration with a NASA API. It shows how to use requestDefaults to set up the basic API call details, and routing to add information for each operation.

version#
Number or Array | Optional
If you have one version of your node, this can be a number. If you want to support more than one version, turn this into an array, containing numbers for each node version.
n8n supports two methods of node versioning, but declarative-style nodes must use the light versioning approach. Refer to Node versioning for more information.
Programmatic-style parameters#
These are the parameters available for node base file of programmatic-style nodes.
This document gives short code snippets to help understand the code structure and concepts. For a full walk-through of building a node, including real-world code examples, refer to Build a programmatic-style node.
Programmatic-style nodes also use the execute() method. Refer to Programmatic-style execute method for more information.
Refer to Standard parameters for parameters available to all nodes.
defaultVersion#
Number | Optional
Use defaultVersion when using the full versioning approach.
n8n support two methods of node versioning. Refer to Node versioning for more information.
methods and loadOptions#
Object | Optional
Contains the loadOptions method for programmatic-style nodes. You can use this method to query the service to get user-specific settings (such as getting a user's email labels from Gmail), then return them and render them in the GUI so the user can include them in subsequent queries.
For example, n8n's Gmail node uses loadOptions to get all email labels:

				const returnData: INodePropertyOptions[] = [];
				const labels = await googleApiRequestAllItems.call(

					const labelName = label.name;
					const labelId = label.id;
					returnData.push({
						name: labelName,
						value: labelId,
					});
				}
				return returnData;
			},
		},
	};



version#
Number or Array | Optional
Use version when using the light versioning approach.
If you have one version of your node, this can be a number. If you want to support multiple versions, turn this into an array, containing numbers for each node version.
n8n support two methods of node versioning. Programmatic-style nodes can use either. Refer to Node versioning for more information.
Programmatic-style execute() method#
The main difference between the declarative and programmatic styles is how they handle incoming data and build API requests. The programmatic style requires an execute() method, which reads incoming data and parameters, then builds a request. The declarative style handles requests using the routing key in the operations object.
The execute() method creates and returns an instance of INodeExecutionData.
Paired items
You must include input and output item pairing information in the data you return. For more information, refer to Paired items.
Node codex files#
The codex file contains metadata about your node. This file is the JSON file at the root of your node. For example, the HttpBin.node.json file in the n8n starter.
The codex filename must match the node base filename. For example, given a node base file named MyNode.node.ts, the codex would be named MyNode.node.json.
Parameter
Description
node
Includes the node name. Must start with n8n-nodes-base.. For example, n8n-nodes-base.openweatherapi.
nodeVersion
The node version. This should have the same value as the version parameter in your main node file. For example, "1.0".
codexVersion
The codex file version. The current version is "1.0".
categories
The settings in the categories array determine which category n8n adds your node to in the GUI. See Node categories for more information.
resources
The resources object contains links to your node documentation. n8n automatically adds help links to credentials and nodes in the GUI.

Node categories#
You can define one or more categories in your node configuration JSON. This helps n8n put the node in the correct category in the nodes panel.
Choose from these categories:
Data & Storage
Finance & Accounting
Marketing & Content
Productivity
Miscellaneous
Sales
Development
Analytics
Communication
Utility
You must match the syntax. For example, Data & Storage not data and storage.
Credentials file#
The credentials file defines the authorization methods for the node. The settings in this file affect what n8n displays in the Credentials modal, and must reflect the authentication requirements of the service you're connecting to.
In the credentials file, you can use all the n8n UI elements. n8n encrypts the data that's stored using credentials using an encryption key.
Structure of the credentials file#
The credentials file follows this basic structure:
Import statements
Create a class for the credentials
Within the class, define the properties that control authentication for the node.

HTTP request helper for node builders#
n8n provides a flexible helper for making HTTP requests, which abstracts away most of the complexity.
Programmatic style only
The information in this document is for node building using the programmatic style. It doesn't apply to declarative style nodes.
Usage#
Call the helper inside the execute function.

{
	url: string;
	headers?: object;
	method?: 'GET' | 'POST' | 'PUT' | 'DELETE' | 'HEAD';

	qs?: object;

		username: string,

	json?: boolean;
}	



url is required. The other fields are optional. The default method is GET.
Some notes about the possible fields:
body: you can use a regular JavaScript object for JSON payload, a buffer for file uploads, an instance of FormData for multipart/form-data, and URLSearchParams for application/x-www-form-urlencoded.
headers: a key-value pair.
If body is an instance of FormData then n8n adds content-type: multipart/form-data automatically.
If body is an instance of URLSearchParams, then n8n adds content-type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded.
To override this behavior, set a content-type header.
arrayFormat: if your query string contains an array of data, such as const qs = {IDs: [15,17]}, the value of arrayFormat defines how n8n formats it.
indices (default): { a: ['b', 'c'] } as a[0]=b&a[1]=c
brackets: { a: ['b', 'c'] } as a[]=b&a[]=c
repeat: { a: ['b', 'c'] } as a=b&a=c
comma: { a: ['b', 'c'] } as a=b,c
auth: Used for Basic auth. Provide username and password. n8n recommends omitting this, and using helpers.httpRequestWithAuthentication(...) instead.
disableFollowRedirect: By default, n8n follows redirects. You can set this to true to prevent this from happening.
skipSslCertificateValidation: Used for calling HTTPS services without proper certificate
returnFullResponse: Instead of returning just the body, returns an object with more data in the following format: {body: body, headers: object, statusCode: 200, statusMessage: 'OK'}
encoding: n8n can detect the content type, but you can specify arrayBuffer to receive a Buffer you can read from and interact with.
Example#
For an example, refer to the Mattermost node.
Deprecation of the previous helper#
The previous helper implementation using this.helpers.request(options) used and exposed the request-promise library. This was removed in version 1.
To minimize incompatibility, n8n made a transparent conversion to another library called Axios.
If you are having issues, please report them in the Community Forums or on GitHub.
Migration guide to the new helper#
The new helper is much more robust, library agnostic, and easier to use.
New nodes should all use the new helper. You should strongly consider migrating existing custom nodes to the new helper. These are the main considerations when migrating:
Accepts url. Doesn't accept uri.
encoding: null now must be encoding: arrayBuffer.
rejectUnauthorized: false is now skipSslCertificateValidation: true
Use body according to content-type headers to clarify the payload.
resolveWithFullResponse is now returnFullResponse and has similar behavior
Item linking#
Programmatic-style nodes only
This guidance applies to programmatic-style nodes. If you're using declarative style, n8n handles paired items for you automatically.
Use n8n's item linking to access data from items that precede the current item. n8n needs to know which input item a given output item comes from. If this information is missing, expressions in other nodes may break. As a node developer, you must ensure any items returned by your node support this.
This applies to programmatic nodes (including trigger nodes). You don't need to consider item linking when building a declarative-style node. Refer to Choose your node building approach for more information on node styles.
Start by reading Item linking concepts, which provides a conceptual overview of item linking, and details of the scenarios where n8n can handle the linking automatically.
If you need to handle item linking manually, do this by setting pairedItem on each item your node returns:

// Use the pairedItem information of the incoming item
newItem = {
	"json": { . . . },
	"pairedItem": {
		"item": item.pairedItem,
		// Optional: choose the input to use
		// Set this if your node combines multiple inputs
		"input": 0
};

// Or set the index manually
newItem = {
		"json": { . . . }
		"pairedItem": {
			"item": i,
			// Optional: choose the input to use
			// Set this if your node combines multiple inputs
			"input": 0
		},
};

UX guidelines for community nodes#
Your node's UI must conform to these guidelines to be a verified community node candidate.
Credentials#
API key and sensitive credentials should always be password fields.
OAuth#
Always include the OAuth credential if available.
Node structure#
Operations to include#
Try to include CRUD operations for each resource type.
Try to include common operations in nodes for each resource. n8n uses some CRUD operations to keep the experience consistent and allow users to perform basic operations on the resource. The suggested operations are:
Create
Create or Update (Upsert)
Delete
Get
Get Many: also used when some filtering or search is available
Update
Notes:
These operations can apply to the resource itself or an entity inside of the resource (for example, a row inside a Google Sheet). When operating on an entity inside of the resource, you must specify the name of the entity in the operations name.
The naming could change depending on the node and the resource. Check the following guidelines for details.
Resource Locator#
Use a Resource Locator component whenever possible. This provides a much better UX for users. The Resource Locator Component is most often useful when you have to select a single item.
The default option for the Resource Locator Component should be From list (if available).
Consistency with other nodes#
Maintain UX consistency: n8n tries to keep its UX consistent. This means following existing UX patterns, in particular, those used in the latest new or overhauled nodes.
Check similar nodes: For example, if you're working on a database node, it's worth checking the Postgres node.
Sorting options#
You can enhance certain "Get Many" operations by providing users with sorting options.
Add sorting in a dedicated collection (below the "Options" collection). Follow the example of Airtable Record:Search.
Node functionality#
Deleting operations output#
When deleting an item (like a record or a row), return an array with a single object: {"deleted": true}. This is a confirmation for the user that the deletion was successful and the item will trigger the following node.
Simplifying output fields#
Normal nodes: 'Simplify' parameter#
When an endpoint returns data with more than 10 fields, add the "Simplify" boolean parameter to return a simplified version of the output with max 10 fields.
One of the main issues with n8n can be the size of data and the Simplify parameter limits that problem by reducing data size.
Select the most useful fields to output in the simplified node and sort them to have the most used ones at the top.
In the Simplify mode, it's often best to flatten nested fields
Display Name: Simplify
Description: Whether to return a simplified version of the response instead of the raw data
AI tool nodes: ‘Output’ parameter#
When an endpoint returns data with more than 10 fields, add the 'Output' option parameter with 3 modes.
In AI tool nodes, allow the user to be more granular and select the fields to output. The rationale is that tools may run out of context window and they can get confused by too many fields, so it's better to pass only the ones they need.
Options:
Simplified: Works the same as the "Simplify" parameter described above.
Raw: Returns all the available fields.
Selected fields: Shows a multi-option parameter for selecting the fields to add to the output and send to the AI agent. By default, this option always returns the ID of the record/entity.
Copy#
Text Case#
Use Title Case for the node name, parameters display names (labels), dropdown titles. Title Case is when you capitalize the first letter of each word, except for certain small words, such as articles and short prepositions.
Use Sentence case for node action names, node descriptions, parameters descriptions (tooltips), hints, dropdown descriptions.
Terminology#
Use the third-party service terminology: Try to use the same terminology as the service you're interfacing with (for example, Notion 'blocks', not Notion 'paragraphs').
Use the terminology used in the UI: Stick to the terminology used in the user interface of the service, rather than that used in the APIs or technical documentation (for example, in Trello you "archive" cards, but in the API they show up as "closed". In this case, you might want to use "archive").
No tech jargon: Don't use technical jargon where simple words will do. For example, use "field" instead of "key".
Consistent naming: Choose one term for something and stick to it. For example, don't mix "directory" and "folder".
Placeholders#
It's often helpful to insert examples of content in parameters placeholders. These should start with "e.g." and use camel case for the demo content in fields.
Placeholder examples to copy:
image: e.g. https://example.com/image.png
video: e.g. https://example.com/video.mp4
search term: e.g. automation
email: e.g. nathan@example.com
Twitter user (or similar): e.g. n8n
Name and last name: e.g. Nathan Smith
First name: e.g. Nathan
Last name: e.g. Smith
Operations name, action, and description#
Name: This is the name displayed in the select when the node is open on the canvas. It must use title case and doesn't have to include the resource (for example, "Delete").
Action: This is the name of the operation displayed in the panel where the user selects the node. It must be in sentence case and must include the resource (for example, "Delete record").
Description: This is the sub-text displayed below the name in the select when the node is open on the canvas. It must use sentence case and must include the resource. It can add a bit of information and use alternative words than the basic resource/operation (for example, "Retrieve a list of users").
If the operation acts on an entity that's not the Resource (for example, a row in a Google Sheet), specify that in the operation name (for example, "Delete Row").
As a general rule, is important to understand what the object of an operation is. Sometimes, the object of an Operation is the resource itself (for example, Sheet:Delete to delete a Sheet).
In other cases, the object of the operation isn't the resource, but something contained inside the resource (for example, Table:Delete rows, here the resource is the table, but what you are operating on are the rows inside of it).
Naming name#
This is the name displayed in the select when the node is open on the canvas.
Parameter: name
Case: Title Case
Naming guidelines:
Don't repeat the resource (if the resource selection is above): The resource is often displayed above the operation, so it's not necessary to repeat it in the operation (this is the case if the object of the operation is the resource itself).
For example: Sheet:Delete → No need to repeat Sheet in Delete, because n8n displays Sheet in the field above and what you're deleting is the Sheet.
Specify the resource if there's no resource selection above: In some nodes, you won't have a resource selection (because there's only one resource). In these cases, specify the resource in the operation.
For example: Delete Records → In Airtable, there's no resource selection, so it's better to specify that the Delete operation will delete records.
Specify the object of the operation if it's not the resource: Sometimes, the object of the operation isn't the resource. In these cases, specify the object in the operation as well.
For example: Table:Get Columns → Specify Columns because the resource is Table, while the object of the operation is Columns.
Naming action#
This is the name of the operation displayed in the panel where the user selects the node. * Parameter: action * Case: Sentence case
Naming guidelines:
Omit articles: To keep the text shorter, get rid of articles (a, an, the…).
correct: Update row in sheet
incorrect: Update a row in a sheet
Repeat the resource: In this case, it's okay to repeat the resource. Even if the resource is visible in the list, the user might not notice and it's useful to repeat it in the operation label.
Specify the object of the operation if it is not the resource: Same as for the operation name. In this case, you don't need to repeat the resource.
For example: Append Rows → You have to specify Rows because rows are what you're actually appending to. Don't add the resource (Sheet) since you aren't appending to the resource.
Naming description#
This is the subtext displayed below the name in the selection when the node is open on the canvas.
Parameter: description
Case: Sentence case
Naming guidelines:
If possible, add more information than that specified in the operation name
Use alternative wording to help users better understand what the operation is doing. Some people might not understand the text used in the operation (maybe English isn't their native language), and using alternative working could help them.
Vocabulary#
n8n uses a general vocabulary and some context-specific vocabulary for groups of similar applications (for example, databases or spreadsheets).
The general vocabulary takes inspiration from CRUD operations:
Clear
Delete all the contents of the resource (empty the resource).
Description: Delete all the <CHILD_ELEMENT>s inside the <RESOURCE>
Create
Create a new instance of the resource.
Description: Create a new <RESOURCE>
Create or Update
Create or update an existing instance of the resource.
Description: Create a new <RESOURCE> or update an existing one (upsert)
Delete
You can use "Delete" in two different ways:
Delete a resource:
Description: Delete a <RESOURCE> permanently (use "permanently" only if that's the case)
Delete something inside of the resource (for example, a row):
In this case, always specify the object of the operation: for example, Delete Rows or Delete Records.
Description: Delete a <CHILD_ELEMENT> permanently
Get
You can use "Get" in two different ways:
Get a resource:
Description: Retrieve a <RESOURCE>
Get an item inside of the resource (for example, records):
In this case, always specify the object of the operation: for example, Get Row or Get Record.
Description: Retrieve a <CHILD_ELEMENT> from the/a <RESOURCE>
Get Many
You can use "Get Many" in two different ways:
Get a list of resources (without filtering):
Description: Retrieve a list of <RESOURCE>s
Get a list of items inside of the resource (for example, records):
In this case, always specify the object of the operation: for example, Get Many Rows or Get Many Records.
You can omit Many: Get Many Rows can be Get Rows.
Description: List all <CHILD_ELEMENT>s in the/a <RESOURCE>
Insert or Append
Add something inside of a resource.
Use insert for database nodes.
Description: Insert <CHILD_ELEMENT>(s) in a <RESOURCE>
Insert or Update or Append or Update
Add or update something inside of a resource.
Use insert for database nodes.
Description: Insert <CHILD_ELEMENT>(s) or update an existing one(s) (upsert)
Update
You can use "Update" in two different ways:
Update a resource:
Description: Update one or more <RESOURCE>s
Update something inside of a resource (for example, a row):
In this case, always specify the object of the operation: for example, Update Rows or Update Records.
Description: Update <CHILD_ELEMENT>(s) inside a <RESOURCE>
Referring to parameter and field name#
When you need to refer to parameter names or field names in copy, wrap them in single quotation marks (for example, "Please fill the 'name' parameter).
Boolean description#
Start the description of boolean components with 'Whether...'
Errors#
General philosophy#
Errors are sources of pain for users. For this reason, n8n always wants to tell the user:
What happened: a description of the error and what went wrong.
How to solve the problem: or at least how to get unstuck and continue using n8n without problems. n8n doesn't want users to remain blocked, so use this as an opportunity to guide them to success.
Error structure in the Output panel#
Error Message - What happened#
This message explains to the user what happened, and the current issue that prevents the execution completing.
If you have the displayName of the parameter that triggered the error, include it in the error message or description (or both).
Item index: if you have the ID of the item that triggered the error, append [Item X] to the error message. For example, The ID of the release in the parameter “Release ID” for could not be found [item 2].
Avoid using words like "error", "problem", "failure", "mistake".
Error Description - How to solve or get unstuck#
The description explains to users how to solve the problem, what to change in the node configuration (if that's the case), or how to get unstuck. Here, you should guide them to the next step and unblock them.
Avoid using words like "error", "problem", "failure", "mistake".
Community node verification guidelines#
Do you want n8n to verify your node?
Consider following these guidelines while building your node if you want to submit it for verification by n8n. Any user with verified community nodes enabled can discover and install verified nodes from n8n's nodes panel.
Package source verification#
Verify that your npm package repository URL matches the expected GitHub (or other platform) repository.
Confirm that the package author / maintainer matches between npm and the repository.
Confirm that the git link in npm works and that the repository is public.
Make sure your package has proper documentation (README, usage examples, etc.).
Make sure your package license is MIT.
No external dependencies#
Ensure that your package does not include any external dependencies to keep it lightweight and easy to maintain.
Proper documentation#
Provide clear documentation, whether it’s a README on GitHub or links to relevant API documentation.
Include usage instructions, example workflows, and any necessary authentication details.
No access to environment variables or file system#
The code must not interact with environment variables or attempt to read/write files.
Pass all necessary data through node parameters.
Follow n8n best practices#
Maintain a clear and consistent coding style.
Use TypeScript and follow n8n's node development guidelines.
Ensure proper error handling and validation.
Make sure the linter passes (in other words, make sure running npx @n8n/scan-community-package n8n-nodes-PACKAGE passes).
Test a node#
This section contains information about testing your node.
There are two ways to test your node:
Manually, by running it on your own machine within a local n8n instance.
Automatically, using the linter.
You should use both methods before publishing your node.
Run your node locally#
You can test your node as you build it by running it in a local n8n instance.
Install n8n using npm:
1
npm install n8n -g



When you are ready to test your node, publish it locally:
1
2
3
# In your node directory
npm run build
npm link




Install the node into your local n8n instance:
1
2
3
# In the nodes directory within your n8n installation
# node-package-name is the name from the package.json
npm link <node-package-name>



Check your directory
Make sure you run npm link <node-name> in the nodes directory within your n8n installation. This can be:
~/.n8n/custom/
~/.n8n/<your-custom-name>: if your n8n installation set a different name using N8N_CUSTOM_EXTENSIONS.
Start n8n:
1
n8n start




Open n8n in your browser. You should see your nodes when you search for them in the nodes panel.
Node names
Make sure you search using the node name, not the package name. For example, if your npm package name is n8n-nodes-weather-nodes, and the package contains nodes named rain, sun, snow, you should search for rain, not weather-nodes.
Troubleshooting#
There's no custom directory in ~/.n8n local installation.
You have to create custom directory manually and run npm init
1

4
# In ~/.n8n directory run
mkdir custom 
cd custom 
npm init

n8n node linter#
n8n's node linter, eslint-plugin-n8n-nodes-base, statically analyzes ("lints") the source code of n8n nodes and credentials in the official repository and in community packages. The linter detects issues and automatically fixes them to help you follow best practices.
eslint-plugin-n8n-nodes-base contains a collection of rules for node files (*.node.ts), resource description files (*Description.ts), credential files (*.credentials.ts), and the package.json of a community package.
Setup#
If using the n8n node starter: Run npm install in the starter project to install all dependencies. Once the installation finishes, the linter is available to you.
If using VS Code, install the ESLint VS Code extension. For other IDEs, refer to their ESLint integrations.
Don't edit the configuration file
.eslintrc.js contains the configuration for eslint-plugin-n8n-nodes-base. Don't edit this file.
Usage#
You can use the linter in a community package or in the main n8n repository.
Linting#
In a community package, the linter runs automatically after installing dependencies and before publishing the package to npm. In the main n8n repository, the linter runs automatically using GitHub Actions whenever you push to your pull request.
In both cases, VS Code lints in the background as you work on your project. Hover over a detected issue to see a full description of the linting and a link to further information.
You can also run the linter manually:
Run npm run lint to lint and view detected issues in your console.
Run npm run lintfix to lint and automatically fix issues. The linter fixes violations of rules marked as automatically fixable.
Both commands can run in the root directory of your community package, or in /packages/nodes-base/ in the main repository.
Exceptions#
Instead of fixing a rule violation, you can also make an exception for it, so the linter doesn't flag it.
To make a lint exception from VS Code: hover over the issue and click on Quick fix (or cmd+. in macOS) and select Disable {rule} for this line. Only disable rules for a line where you have good reason to. If you think the linter is incorrectly reporting an issue, please report it in the linter repository.
To add a lint exception to a single file, add a code comment. In particular, TSLint rules may not show up in VS Code and may need to be turned off using code comments. Refer to the TSLint documentation for more guidance.
Troubleshooting#
Credentials#
Error message: 'Credentials of type "*" aren't known'#
Check that the name in the credentials array matches the name used in the property name of the credentials' class.

Editor UI#
Error message: 'There was a problem loading init data: API-Server can not be reached. It's probably down'#
Check that the names of the node file, node folder, and class match the path added to packages/nodes-base/package.json.
Check that the names used in the displayOptions property are names used by UI elements in the node.
Node icon doesn't show up in the Add Node menu and the Editor UI#
Check that the icon is in the same folder as the node.
Check that it's either in PNG or SVG format.
When the icon property references the icon file, check that it includes the logo extension (.png or .svg) and that it prefixes it with file:. For example, file:friendGrid.png or file:friendGrid.svg.
Node icon doesn't fit#
If you use an SVG file, make sure the canvas size is square. You can find instructions to change the canvas size of an SVG file using GIMP here.
If you use a PNG file, make sure that it's 60x60 pixels.
Node doesn't show up in the Add Node menu#
Check that you registered the node in the package.json file in your project.
Changes to the description properties don't show in the UI on refreshing#
Every time you change the description properties, you have to stop the current n8n process (ctrl + c) and run it again. You may also need to re-run npm link.
Linter incorrectly warning about file name case#
The node linter has rules for file names, including what case they should be. Windows users may encounter an issue when renaming files that causes the linter to continue giving warnings, even after you rename the files. This is due to a known Windows issue with changing case when renaming files.
Deploy a node#
This section contains details on how to deploy and share your node.
You can choose to:
Submit your node to the community node repository. This makes it available for everyone to use, and allows you to install and use it like any other community node. This is the only way to use custom nodes on cloud.
Install the node into your n8n instance as a private node.
Submit community nodes#
Subject to change
The standards described in this document are for the first release of the community nodes repository. These may change in future releases.
Community nodes are npm packages, hosted in the npm registry.
When building a node to submit to the community node repository, use the following resources to make sure your node setup is correct:
View the starter node and n8n's own nodes for some examples.
Refer to the documentation on building your own nodes.
Make sure your node follows the standards for community nodes.
Standards#
To make your node available to the n8n community node repository, you must:
Make sure the package name starts with n8n-nodes- or @<scope>/n8n-nodes-. For example, n8n-nodes-weather or @weatherPlugins/n8n-nodes-weather.
Include n8n-community-node-package in your package keywords.
Make sure that you add your nodes and credentials to the package.json file inside the n8n attribute. Refer to the package.json in the starter node for an example.
Check your node using the linter and test it locally to ensure it works.
Submit the package to the npm registry. Refer to npm's documentation on Contributing packages to the registry for more information.
Submit your node for verification by n8n#
n8n vets verified community nodes. Users can discover and install verified community nodes from the nodes panel in n8n. These nodes need to adhere to certain technical and UX standards and constraints.
Before submitting your node for review by n8n, you must:
Make sure that your node follows the technical guidelines for verified community nodes and that all automated checks pass. Specifically, verified community nodes aren't allowed to use any run-time dependencies.
Ensure that your node follows the UX guidelines.
Make sure that the node has appropriate documentation in the form of a README in the npm package or a related public repository.
Submit your node to npm as n8n will fetch it from there for final vetting.
If your node meets all the above requirements, click here to submit your node for verification.
Install private nodes#
You can build your own nodes and install them in your n8n instance without publishing them on npm. This is useful for nodes that you create for internal use only at your company.
Install your node in a Docker n8n instance#
If you're running n8n using Docker, you need to create a Docker image with the node installed in n8n.
Create a Dockerfile and paste the code from this Dockerfile.
Your Dockerfile should look like this:

Compile your custom node code (npm run build if you are using nodes starter). Copy the node and credential folders from within the dist folder into your container's ~/.n8n/custom/ directory. This makes them available to Docker.
Download the docker-entrypoint.sh file, and place it in the same directory as your Dockerfile.
Build your Docker image:
1
2
3
# Replace <n8n-version-number> with the n8n release version number. 
# For example, N8N_VERSION=0.177.0
docker build --build-arg N8N_VERSION=<n8n-version-number> --tag=customizedn8n .



You can now use your node in Docker.
Install your node in a global n8n instance#
If you've installed n8n globally, make sure that you install your node inside n8n. n8n will find the module and load it automatically.


Install and manage community nodes#
There are three ways to install community nodes:
Within n8n using the nodes panel (for verified community nodes only).
Within n8n using the GUI: Use this method to install community nodes from the npm registry.
Manually from the command line: use this method to install community nodes from npm if your n8n instance doesn't support installation through the in-app GUI.
Installing from npm only available on self-hosted instances
Unverified community nodes aren't available on n8n cloud and require self-hosting n8n.
Install verified community nodes in the n8n app#
Limited to n8n instance owners
Only the n8n instance owner can install and manage verified community nodes. The instance owner is the person who sets up and manages user management. All members of an n8n instance can use already installed community nodes in their workflows.
Admin accounts can also uninstall any community node, verified or unverified. This helps them remove problematic nodes that may affect the instance's health and functionality.
Install a community node#
To install a verified community node:
Go to the Canvas and open the nodes panel (either by selecting '+' or pressing Tab).
Search for the node that you're looking for. If there is a matching verified community node, you will see a More from the community section at the bottom of the nodes panel.
Select the node you want to install. This takes you to a detailed view of the node, showing all the supported actions.
Select install. This will install the node for your instance and enable all members to use it in their workflows.
You can now add the node to your workflows.
Enable installation of verified community nodes
Some users may not want to show verified community nodes in the nodes panel of their instances. On n8n cloud, instance owners can toggle this in the Cloud Admin Panel. Self-hosted users can use environment variables to control the availability of this feature.
Uninstall a community node#
To uninstall a community node:
Go to Settings > Community nodes.
On the node you want to install, select Options .
Select Uninstall package.
Select Uninstall Package in the confirmation modal.
Install community nodes from npm in the n8n app#
Only for instance owners of self-hosted n8n instances
Only the n8n instance owner of a self-hosted n8n instance can install and manage community nodes from npm. The instance owner is the person who sets up and manages user management.
Admin accounts can also uninstall any community node, verified or unverified. This helps them remove problematic nodes that may affect the instance's health and functionality.
Install a community node#
To install a community node from npm:
Go to Settings > Community Nodes.
Select Install.
Find the node you want to install:
Select Browse. n8n takes you to an npm search results page, showing all npm packages tagged with the keyword n8n-community-node-package.
Browse the list of results. You can filter the results or add more keywords.
Once you find the package you want, make a note of the package name. If you want to install a specific version, make a note of the version number as well.
Return to n8n.
Enter the npm package name, and version number if required. For example, consider a community node designed to access a weather API called "Storms." The package name is n8n-node-storms, and it has three major versions.
To install the latest version of a package called n8n-node-weather: enter n8n-nodes-storms in Enter npm package name.
To install version 2.3: enter n8n-node-storms@2.3 in Enter npm package name.
Agree to the risks of using community nodes: select I understand the risks of installing unverified code from a public source.
Select Install. n8n installs the node, and returns to the Community Nodes list in Settings.
Nodes on the blocklist
n8n maintains a blocklist of community nodes that it prevents you from installing. Refer to n8n community node blocklist for more information.
Uninstall a community node#
To uninstall a community node:
Go to Settings > Community nodes.
On the node you want to install, select Options .
Select Uninstall package.
Select Uninstall Package in the confirmation modal.
Upgrade a community node#
Breaking changes in versions
Node developers may introduce breaking changes in new versions of their nodes. A breaking change is an update that breaks previous functionality. Depending on the node versioning approach that a node developer chooses, upgrading to a version with a breaking change could cause all workflows using the node to break. Be careful when upgrading your nodes. If you find that an upgrade causes issues, you can downgrade.
Upgrade to the latest version#
You can upgrade community nodes to the latest version from the node list in Settings > community nodes.
When a new version of a community node is available, n8n displays an Update button on the node. Click the button to upgrade to the latest version.
Upgrade to a specific version#
To upgrade to a specific version (a version other than the latest), uninstall the node, then reinstall it, making sure to specify the target version. Follow the Installation instructions for more guidance.
Downgrade a community node#
If there is a problem with a particular version of a community node, you may want to roll back to a previous version.
To do this, uninstall the community node, then reinstall it, targeting a specific node version. Follow the Installation instructions for more guidance.
Manually install community nodes from npm#
You can manually install community nodes from the npm registry on self-hosted n8n.
You need to manually install community nodes in the following circumstances:
Your n8n instance runs in queue mode.
You want to install private packages.
Install a community node#
Access your Docker shell:
1
docker exec -it n8n sh



Create ~/.n8n/nodes if it doesn't already exist, and navigate into it:
1
2
mkdir ~/.n8n/nodes
cd ~/.n8n/nodes



Install the node:
1
npm i n8n-nodes-nodeName



Then restart n8n.
Uninstall a community node#
Access your Docker shell:
1
docker exec -it n8n sh



Run npm uninstall:
1
npm uninstall n8n-nodes-nodeName



Upgrade a community node#
Breaking changes in versions
Node developers may introduce breaking changes in new versions of their nodes. A breaking change is an update that breaks previous functionality. Depending on the node versioning approach that a node developer chooses, upgrading to a version with a breaking change could cause all workflows using the node to break. Be careful when upgrading your nodes. If you find that an upgrade causes issues, you can downgrade.
Upgrade to the latest version#
Access your Docker shell:
1
docker exec -it n8n sh



Run npm update:
1
npm update n8n-nodes-nodeName



Upgrade or downgrade to a specific version#
Access your Docker shell:
1
docker exec -it n8n sh



Run npm uninstall to remove the current version:
1
npm uninstall n8n-nodes-nodeName



Run npm install with the version specified:
1
2
# Replace 2.1.0 with your version number
npm install n8n-nodes-nodeName@2.1.0

Risks when using community nodes#
Installing community nodes from npm means you are installing unverified code from a public source into your n8n instance. This has some risks.
Risks include:
System security: community nodes have full access to the machine that n8n runs on, and can do anything, including malicious actions.
Data security: any community node that you use has access to data in your workflows.
Breaking changes: node developers may introduce breaking changes in new versions of their nodes. A breaking change is an update that breaks previous functionality. Depending on the node versioning approach that a node developer chooses, upgrading to a version with a breaking change could cause all workflows using the node to break. Be careful when upgrading your nodes.
n8n vets verified community nodes
In addition to publicly available community nodes from npm, n8n inspects some nodes and makes them available as verified community node inside the nodes panel. These nodes have to meet a set of data and system security requirements for approval.
Report bad community nodes#
You can report bad community nodes to security@n8n.io
Disable community nodes#
If you are self-hosting n8n, you can disable community nodes by setting N8N_COMMUNITY_PACKAGES_ENABLED to false. On n8n cloud, visit the Cloud Admin Panel and disable community nodes from there. See troubleshooting for more information.
n8n community node blocklist#
n8n maintains a blocklist of community nodes. You can't install any node on this list.
n8n may add community nodes to the blocklist for a range of reasons, including:
The node is intentionally malicious
It's low quality (low enough to be harmful)
If you are a community node creator whose node is on the blocklist, and you believe this is a mistake, contact hello@n8n.io.
Using community nodes#
To use community nodes, you first need to install them.
Adding community nodes to your workflow#
After installing a community node, you can use it like any other node. n8n displays the node in search results in the Nodes panel. n8n marks community nodes with a Package  icon in the nodes panel.
Community nodes with duplicate names#
It's possible for several community nodes to have the same name. If you use two nodes with the same name in your workflow, they'll look the same, unless they have different icons.
Troubleshooting and errors#
Error: Missing packages#
n8n installs community nodes directly onto the hard disk. The files must be available at startup for n8n to load them. If the packages aren't available at startup, you get an error warning of missing packages.
If running n8n using Docker: depending on your Docker setup, you may lose the packages when you recreate your container or upgrade your n8n version. You must either:
Persist the contents of the ~/.n8n/nodes directory. This is the best option. If you follow the Docker installation guide, the setup steps include persisting this directory.
Set the N8N_REINSTALL_MISSING_PACKAGES environment variable to true.
The second option might increase startup time and may cause health checks to fail.
Prevent loading community nodes on n8n cloud#
If your n8n cloud instance crashes and fails to start, you can prevent installed community nodes from loading on instance startup. Visit the Cloud Admin Panel > Manage and toggle Disable all community nodes to true. This toggle is only visible when you allow community node installation.

Creating nodes#
Learn how to build your own custom nodes.
This section includes:
Guidance on planning your build, including which style to use.
Tutorials for different node building styles.
Instructions for testing your node, including how to use the n8n node linter and troubleshooting support.
How to share your node with the community, submit it for verification by n8n, or use it as a private node.
Reference material, including UI elements and information on the individual files that make up a node.
Prerequisites#
This section assumes the following:
Some familiarity with JavaScript and TypeScript.
Ability to manage your own development environment, including git.
Knowledge of npm, including creating and submitting packages.
Familiarity with n8n, including a good understanding of data structures and item linking.
Plan a node#
This section provides guidance on designing your node, including key technical decisions such as choosing your node building style.
When building a node, there are design choices you need to make before you start:
Which node type you need to build.
Which node building style to use.
Your UI design and UX principles
Your node's file structure.
Node types: Trigger and Action#
There are two node types you can build for n8n: trigger nodes and action nodes.
Both types provide integrations with external services.
Trigger nodes#
Trigger nodes start a workflow and supply the initial data. A workflow can contain multiple trigger nodes but with each execution, only one of them will execute, depending on the triggering event.
There are three types of trigger nodes in n8n:
Type
Description
Example Nodes
Webhook
Nodes for services that support webhooks. These nodes listen for events and trigger workflows in real time.
Zendesk Trigger, Telegram Trigger, Brevo Trigger
Polling
Nodes for services that don't support webhooks. These nodes periodically check for new data, triggering workflows when they detect updates.
Airtable Trigger, Gmail Trigger, Google Sheet Trigger, RssFeed Read Trigger
Others
Nodes that handle real-time responses not related to HTTP requests or polling. This includes message queue nodes and time-based triggers.
AMQP Trigger, RabbitMQ Trigger, MQTT Trigger, Schedule Trigger, Email Trigger (IMAP)

Action nodes#
Action nodes perform operations as part of your workflow. These can include manipulating data, and triggering events in other systems.
Choose your node building approach#
n8n has two node-building styles, declarative and programmatic.
You should use the declarative style for most nodes. This style:
Uses a JSON-based syntax, making it simpler to write, with less risk of introducing bugs.
Is more future-proof.
Supports integration with REST APIs.
The programmatic style is more verbose. You must use the programmatic style for:
Trigger nodes
Any node that isn't REST-based. This includes nodes that need to call a GraphQL API and nodes that use external dependencies.
Any node that needs to transform incoming data.
Full versioning. Refer to Node versioning for more information on types of versioning.
Data handling differences#
The main difference between the declarative and programmatic styles is how they handle incoming data and build API requests. The programmatic style requires an execute() method, which reads incoming data and parameters, then builds a request. The declarative style handles this using the routing key in the operations object. Refer to Node base file for more information on node parameters and the execute() method.
Syntax differences#
To understand the difference between the declarative and programmatic styles, compare the two code snippets below. This example creates a simplified version of the SendGrid integration, called "FriendGrid." The following code snippets aren't complete: they emphasize the differences in the node building styles.
In programmatic style:

Design your node's user interface#
Most nodes are a GUI (graphical user interface) representation of an API. Designing the interface means finding a user-friendly way to represent API endpoints and parameters. Directly translating an entire API into form fields in a node may not result in a good user experience.
This document provides design guidance and standards to follow. These guidelines are the same as those used by n8n. This helps provide a smooth and consistent user experience for users mixing community and built-in nodes.
Design guidance#
All node's use n8n's node UI elements, so you don't need to consider style details such as colors, borders, and so on. However, it's still useful to go through a basic design process:
Review the documentation for the API you're integrating. Ask yourself:
What can you leave out?
What can you simplify?
Which parts of the API are confusing? How can you help users understand them?
Use a wireframe tool to try out your field layout. If you find your node has a lot of fields and is getting confusing, consider n8n's guidance on showing and hiding fields.
Standards#
UI text style#
Element
Style
Drop-down value
Title case
Hint
Sentence case
Info box
Sentence case. Don't use a period (.) for one-sentence information. Always use a period if there's more than one sentence. This field can include links, which should open in a new tab.
Node name
Title case
Parameter name
Title case
Subtitle
Title case
Tooltip
Sentence case. Don't use a period (.) for one-sentence tooltips. Always use a period if there's more than one sentence. This field can include links, which should open in a new tab.

UI text terminology#
Use the same terminology as the service the node connects to. For example, a Notion node should refer to Notion blocks, not Notion paragraphs, because Notion calls these elements blocks. There are exceptions to this rule, usually to avoid technical terms (for example, refer to the guidance on name and description for upsert operations).
Sometimes a service has different terms for something in its API and in its GUI. Use the GUI language in your node, as this is what most users are familiar with. If you think some users may need to refer to the service's API docs, consider including this information in a hint.
Don't use technical jargon when there are simpler alternatives.
Be consistent when naming things. For example, choose one of directory or folder then stick to it.
Node naming conventions#
Convention
Correct
Incorrect
If a node is a trigger node,
the displayed name should have 'Trigger' at the end,
with a space before.
Shopify Trigger
ShopifyTrigger, Shopify trigger
Don't include 'node' in the name.
Asana
Asana Node, Asana node

Showing and hiding fields#
Fields can either be:
Displayed when the node opens: use this for resources and operations, and required fields.
Hidden in the Optional fields section until a user clicks on that section: use this for optional fields.
Progressively disclose complexity: hide a field until any earlier fields it depends on have values. For example, if you have a Filter by date toggle, and a Date to filter by datepicker, don't display Date to filter by until the user enables Filter by date.
Conventions by field type#
Credentials#
n8n automatically displays credential fields as the top fields in the node.
Resources and operations#
APIs usually involve doing something to data. For example, "get all tasks." In this example, "task" is the resource, and "get all" is the operation.
When your node has this resource and operation pattern, your first field should be Resource, and your second field should be Operation.
Required fields#
Order fields by:
Most important to least important.
Scope: from broad to narrow. For example, you have fields for Document, Page, and Text to insert, put them in that order.
Optional fields#
Order fields alphabetically. To group similar things together, you can rename them. For example, rename Email and Secondary Email to Email (primary) and Email (secondary).
If an optional field has a default value that the node uses when the value isn't set, load the field with that value. Explain this in the field description. For example, Defaults to false.
Connected fields: if one optional fields is dependent on another, bundle them together. They should both be under a single option that shows both fields when selected.
If you have a lot of optional fields, consider grouping them by theme.
Help#
There are five types of help built in to the GUI:
Info boxes: yellow boxes that appear between fields. Refer to UI elements | Notice for more information.
Use info boxes for essential information. Don't over-use them. By making them rare, they stand out more and grab the user's attention.
Parameter hints: lines of text displayed beneath a user input field. Use this when there's something the user needs to know, but an info box would be excessive.
Node hints: provide help in the input panel, output panel, or node details view. Refer to UI elements | Hints for more information.
Tooltips: callouts that appear when the user hovers over the tooltip icon . Use tooltips for extra information that the user might need.
You don't have to provide a tooltip for every field. Only add one if it contains useful information.
When writing tooltips, think about what the user needs. Don't just copy-paste API parameter descriptions. If the description doesn't make sense, or has errors, improve it.
Placeholder text: n8n can display placeholder text in a field where the user hasn't entered a value. This can help the user know what's expected in that field.
Info boxes, hints, and tooltips can contain links to more information.
Errors#
Make it clear which fields are required.
Add validation rules to fields if possible. For example, check for valid email patterns if the field expects an email.
When displaying errors, make sure only the main error message displays in the red error title. More information should go in Details.
Toggles#
Tooltips for binary states should start with something like Whether to . . . .
You may need a list rather than a toggle:
Use toggles when it's clear what happens in a false state. For example, Simplify Output?. The alternative (don't simplify output) is clear.
Use a dropdown list with named options when you need more clarity. For example, Append?. What happens if you don't append is unclear (it could be that nothing happens, or information is overwritten, or discarded).
Lists#
Set default values for lists whenever possible. The default should be the most-used option.
Sort list options alphabetically.
You can include list option descriptions. Only add descriptions if they provide useful information.
If there is an option like All, use the word All, not shorthand like *.
Trigger node inputs#
When a trigger node has a parameter for specifying which events to trigger on:
Name the parameter Trigger on.
Don't include a tooltip.
Subtitles#
Set subtitles based on the values of the main parameters. For example:
1
subtitle: '={{$parameter["operation"] + ": " + $parameter["resource"]}}',



IDs#
When performing an operation on a specific record, such as "update a task comment" you need a way to specify which record you want to change.
Wherever possible, provide two ways to specify a record:
By choosing from a pre-populated list. You can generate this list using the loadOptions parameter. Refer to Base files for more information.
By entering an ID.
Name the field <Record name> name or ID. For example, Workspace Name or ID. Add a tooltip saying "Choose a name from the list, or specify an ID using an expression." Link to n8n's Expressions documentation.
Build your node so that it can handle users providing more information than required. For example:
If you need a relative path, handle the user pasting in the absolute path.
If the user needs to get an ID from a URL, handle the user pasting in the entire URL.
Dates and timestamps#
n8n uses ISO timestamp strings for dates and times. Make sure that any date or timestamp field you add supports all ISO 8601 formats.
JSON#
You should support two ways of specifying the content of a text input that expects JSON:
Typing JSON directly into the text input: you need to parse the resulting string into a JSON object.
Using an expression that returns JSON.
Node icons#
Common patterns and exceptions#
This section provides guidance on handling common design patterns, including some edge cases and exceptions to the main standards.
Simplify responses#
APIs can return a lot of data that isn't useful. Consider adding a toggle that allows users to choose to simplify the response data:
Name: Simplify Response
Description: Whether to return a simplified version of the response instead of the raw data
Upsert operations#
This should always be a separate operation with:
Name: Create or Update
Description: Create a new record, or update the current one if it already exists (upsert)
Boolean operators#
n8n doesn't have good support for combining boolean operators, such as AND and OR, in the GUI. Whenever possible, provide options for all ANDs or all ORs.
For example, you have a field called Must match to test if values match. Include options to test for Any and All, as separate options.
Source keys or binary properties#
Binary data is file data, such as spreadsheets or images. In n8n, you need a named key to reference the data. Don't use the terms "binary data" or "binary property" for this field. Instead, use a more descriptive name: Input data field name / Output data field name.
Node file structure#
Following best practices and standards in your node structure makes your node easier to maintain. It's helpful if other people need to work with the code.
The file and directory structure of your node depends on:
Your node's complexity.
Whether you use node versioning.
How many nodes you include in the npm package.
Required files and directories#
Your node must include:
A package.json file at the root of the project. This is required for any npm module.
A nodes directory, containing the code for your node:
This directory must contain the base file, in the format <node-name>.node.ts. For example, MyNode.node.ts.
n8n recommends including a codex file, containing metadata for your node. The codex filename must match the node base filename. For example, given a node base file named MyNode.node.ts, the codex name is MyNode.node.json.
The nodes directory can contain other files and subdirectories, including directories for versions, and node code split across more than one file to create a modular structure.
A credentials directory, containing your credentials code. This code lives in a single credentials file. The filename format is <node-name>.credentials.ts. For example, MyNode.credentials.ts.
Modular structure#
You can choose whether to place all your node's functionality in one file, or split it out into a base file and other modules, which the base file then imports. Unless your node is very simple, it's a best practice to split it out.
A basic pattern is to separate out operations. Refer to the HttpBin starter node for an example of this.
For more complex nodes, n8n recommends a directory structure. Refer to the Airtable node or Microsoft Outlook node as examples.
actions: a directory containing sub-directories that represent resources.
Each sub-directory should contain two types of files:
An index file with resource description (named either <resourceName>.resource.ts or index.ts)
Files for operations <operationName>.operation.ts. These files should have two exports: description of the operation and an execute function.
methods: an optional directory dynamic parameters' functions.
transport: a directory containing the communication implementation.
Versioning#
If your node has more than one version, and you're using full versioning, this makes the file structure more complex. You need a directory for each version, along with a base file that sets the default version. Refer to Node versioning for more information on working with versions, including types of versioning.
Decide how many nodes to include in a package#
There are two possible setups when building a node:
One node in one npm package.
More than one node in a single npm package.
n8n supports both approaches. If you include more than one node, each node should have its own directory in the nodes directory.
A best-practice example for programmatic nodes#
n8n's built-in Airtable node implements a modular structure and versioning, following recommended patterns.
Node base file#
The node base file contains the core code of your node. All nodes must have a base file. The contents of this file are different depending on whether you're building a declarative-style or programmatic-style node. For guidance on which style to use, refer to Choose your node building approach.
These documents give short code snippets to help understand the code structure and concepts. For full walk-throughs of building a node, including real-world code examples, refer to Build a declarative-style node or Build a programmatic-style node.
You can also explore the n8n-nodes-starter and n8n's own nodes for a wider range of examples. The starter contains basic examples that you can build on. The n8n Mattermost node is a good example of a more complex programmatic-style node, including versioning.
For all nodes, refer to the:
Structure of the node base file
Standard parameters
For declarative-style nodes, refer to the:
Declarative-style parameters
For programmatic-style nodes, refer to the:
Programmatic-style parameters
Programmatic-style execute() method
Structure of the node base file#
The node base file follows this basic structure:
Add import statements.
Create a class for the node.
Within the node class, create a description object, which defines the node.
A programmatic-style node also has an execute() method, which reads incoming data and parameters, then builds a request. The declarative style handles this using the routing key in the properties object, within descriptions.

};



Refer to Standard parameters for information on parameters available to all node types. Refer to Programmatic-style parameters and Programmatic-style execute method for more information on working with programmatic-style nodes.
Standard parameters#
These are the standard parameters for the node base file. They're the same for all node types.
displayName#
String | Required
This is the name users see in the n8n GUI.
name#
String | Required
The internal name of the object. Used to reference it from other places in the node.
icon#
String or Object | Required
Specifies an icon for a particular node. n8n recommends uploading your own image file.
You can provide the icon file name as a string, or as an object to handle different icons for light and dark modes. If the icon works in both light and dark modes, use a string that starts with file:, indicating the path to the icon file. For example:
1
icon: 'file:exampleNodeIcon.svg'



To provide different icons for light and dark modes, use an object with light and dark properties. For example:
1
2
3
4
icon: { 
  light: 'file:exampleNodeIcon.svg', 
  dark: 'file:exampleNodeIcon.dark.svg' 
}



n8n recommends using an SVG for your node icon, but you can also use PNG. If using PNG, the icon resolution should be 60x60px. Node icons should have a square or near-square aspect ratio.
Don't reference Font Awesome
If you want to use a Font Awesome icon in your node, download and embed the image.
group#
Array of strings | Required
Tells n8n how the node behaves when the workflow runs. Options are:
trigger: node waits for a trigger.
schedule: node waits for a timer to expire.
input, output, transform: these currently have no effect.
An empty array, []. Use this as the default option if you don't need trigger or schedule.
description#
String | Required
A short description of the node. n8n uses this in the GUI.
defaults#
Object | Required
Contains essential brand and name settings.
The object can include:
name: String. Used as the node name on the canvas if the displayName is too long.
color: String. Hex color code. Provide the brand color of the integration for use in n8n.
forceInputNodeExecution#
Boolean | Optional
When building a multi-input node, you can choose to force all preceding nodes on all branches to execute before the node runs. The default is false (requiring only one input branch to run).
inputs#
Array of strings | Required
Names the input connectors. Controls the number of connectors the node has on the input side. If you need only one connector, use input: ['main'].
outputs#
Array of strings | Required
Names the output connectors. Controls the number of connectors the node has on the output side. If you need only one connector, use output: ['main'].
requiredInputs#
Integer or Array | Optional
Used for multi-input nodes. Specify inputs by number that must have data (their branches must run) before the node can execute.
credentials#
Array of objects | Required
This parameter tells n8n the credential options. Each object defines an authentication type.
The object must include:
name: the credential name. Must match the name property in the credential file. For example, name: 'asanaApi' in Asana.node.ts links to name = 'asanaApi' in AsanaApi.credential.ts.
required: Boolean. Specify whether authentication is required to use this node.
requestDefaults#
Object | Required
Set up the basic information for the API calls the node makes.
This object must include:
baseURL: The API base URL.
You can also add:
headers: an object describing the API call headers, such as content type.
url: string. Appended to the baseURL. You can usually leave this out. It's more common to provide this in the operations.
properties#
Array of objects | Required
This contains the resource and operations objects that define node behaviors, as well as objects to set up mandatory and optional fields that can receive user input.
Resource objects#
A resource object includes the following parameters:
displayName: String. This should always be Resource.
name: String. This should always be resource.
type: String. Tells n8n which UI element to use, and what input type to expect. For example, options results in n8n adding a dropdown that allows users to choose one option. Refer to Node UI elements for more information.
noDataExpression: Boolean. Prevents using an expression for the parameter. Must always be true for resource.
Operations objects#
The operations object defines the available operations on a resource.
displayName: String. This should always be Options.
name: String. This should always be option.
type: String. Tells n8n which UI element to use, and what input type to expect. For example, dateTime results in n8n adding a date picker. Refer to Node UI elements for more information.
noDataExpression: Boolean. Prevents using an expression for the parameter. Must always be true for operation.
options: Array of objects. Each objects describes an operation's behavior, such as its routing, the REST verb it uses, and so on. An options object includes:
name. String.
value. String.
action: String. This parameter combines the resource and operation. You should always include it, as n8n will use it in future versions. For example, given a resource called "Card" and an operation "Get all", your action is "Get all cards".
description: String.
routing: Object containing request details.
Additional fields objects#
These objects define optional parameters. n8n displays them under Additional Fields in the GUI. Users can choose which parameters to set.
The objects must include:

  show: {
    resource: [
      // Resource names
    ],
    operation: [
      // Operation names
    ]
  },
}



For more information about UI element types, refer to UI elements.
Declarative-style parameters#
These are the parameters available for node base file of declarative-style nodes.
This document gives short code snippets to help understand the code structure and concepts. For a full walk-through of building a node, including real-world code examples, refer to Build a declarative-style node.
Refer to Standard parameters for parameters available to all nodes.
methods and loadOptions#
Object | Optional
methods contains the loadOptions object. You can use loadOptions to query the service to get user-specific settings, then return them and render them in the GUI so the user can include them in subsequent queries. The object must include routing information for how to query the service, and output settings that define how to handle the returned options. For example:

				],
			},
		},
	}
},



routing#
Object | Required
routing is an object used within an options array in operations and input field objects. It contains the details of an API call.
The code example below comes from the Declarative-style tutorial. It sets up an integration with a NASA API. It shows how to use requestDefaults to set up the basic API call details, and routing to add information for each operation.

        ]
      }
    ]
}



version#
Number or Array | Optional
If you have one version of your node, this can be a number. If you want to support more than one version, turn this into an array, containing numbers for each node version.
n8n supports two methods of node versioning, but declarative-style nodes must use the light versioning approach. Refer to Node versioning for more information.
Programmatic-style parameters#
These are the parameters available for node base file of programmatic-style nodes.
This document gives short code snippets to help understand the code structure and concepts. For a full walk-through of building a node, including real-world code examples, refer to Build a programmatic-style node.
Programmatic-style nodes also use the execute() method. Refer to Programmatic-style execute method for more information.
Refer to Standard parameters for parameters available to all nodes.
defaultVersion#
Number | Optional
Use defaultVersion when using the full versioning approach.
n8n support two methods of node versioning. Refer to Node versioning for more information.
methods and loadOptions#
Object | Optional
Contains the loadOptions method for programmatic-style nodes. You can use this method to query the service to get user-specific settings (such as getting a user's email labels from Gmail), then return them and render them in the GUI so the user can include them in subsequent queries.
For example, n8n's Gmail node uses loadOptions to get all email labels:

	methods = {
		loadOptions: {
			// Get all the labels and display them
			async getLabels(
				this: ILoadOptionsFunctions,
			): Promise<INodePropertyOptions[]> {
				const returnData: INodePropertyOptions[] = [];
				const labels = await googleApiRequestAllItems.call(
					this,
					'labels',
					'GET',
					'/gmail/v1/users/me/labels',
				);
				for (const label of labels) {
					const labelName = label.name;
					const labelId = label.id;
					returnData.push({
						name: labelName,
						value: labelId,
					});
				}
				return returnData;
			},
		},
	};



version#
Number or Array | Optional
Use version when using the light versioning approach.
If you have one version of your node, this can be a number. If you want to support multiple versions, turn this into an array, containing numbers for each node version.
n8n support two methods of node versioning. Programmatic-style nodes can use either. Refer to Node versioning for more information.
Programmatic-style execute() method#
The main difference between the declarative and programmatic styles is how they handle incoming data and build API requests. The programmatic style requires an execute() method, which reads incoming data and parameters, then builds a request. The declarative style handles requests using the routing key in the operations object.
The execute() method creates and returns an instance of INodeExecutionData.
Paired items
You must include input and output item pairing information in the data you return. For more information, refer to Paired items.
Node codex files#
The codex file contains metadata about your node. This file is the JSON file at the root of your node. For example, the HttpBin.node.json file in the n8n starter.
The codex filename must match the node base filename. For example, given a node base file named MyNode.node.ts, the codex would be named MyNode.node.json.
Parameter
Description
node
Includes the node name. Must start with n8n-nodes-base.. For example, n8n-nodes-base.openweatherapi.
nodeVersion
The node version. This should have the same value as the version parameter in your main node file. For example, "1.0".
codexVersion
The codex file version. The current version is "1.0".
categories
The settings in the categories array determine which category n8n adds your node to in the GUI. See Node categories for more information.
resources
The resources object contains links to your node documentation. n8n automatically adds help links to credentials and nodes in the GUI.

Node categories#
You can define one or more categories in your node configuration JSON. This helps n8n put the node in the correct category in the nodes panel.
Choose from these categories:
Data & Storage
Finance & Accounting
Marketing & Content
Productivity
Miscellaneous
Sales
Development
Analytics
Communication
Utility
You must match the syntax. For example, Data & Storage not data and storage.
Credentials file#
The credentials file defines the authorization methods for the node. The settings in this file affect what n8n displays in the Credentials modal, and must reflect the authentication requirements of the service you're connecting to.
In the credentials file, you can use all the n8n UI elements. n8n encrypts the data that's stored using credentials using an encryption key.
Structure of the credentials file#
The credentials file follows this basic structure:
Import statements
Create a class for the credentials
Within the class, define the properties that control authentication for the node.

HTTP request helper for node builders#
n8n provides a flexible helper for making HTTP requests, which abstracts away most of the complexity.
Programmatic style only
The information in this document is for node building using the programmatic style. It doesn't apply to declarative style nodes.
Usage#
Call the helper inside the execute function.

{
	url: string;
	headers?: object;
	method?: 'GET' | 'POST' | 'PUT' | 'DELETE' | 'HEAD';

	qs?: object;

		username: string,

	};

	json?: boolean;
}	



url is required. The other fields are optional. The default method is GET.
Some notes about the possible fields:
body: you can use a regular JavaScript object for JSON payload, a buffer for file uploads, an instance of FormData for multipart/form-data, and URLSearchParams for application/x-www-form-urlencoded.
headers: a key-value pair.
If body is an instance of FormData then n8n adds content-type: multipart/form-data automatically.
If body is an instance of URLSearchParams, then n8n adds content-type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded.
To override this behavior, set a content-type header.
arrayFormat: if your query string contains an array of data, such as const qs = {IDs: [15,17]}, the value of arrayFormat defines how n8n formats it.
indices (default): { a: ['b', 'c'] } as a[0]=b&a[1]=c
brackets: { a: ['b', 'c'] } as a[]=b&a[]=c
repeat: { a: ['b', 'c'] } as a=b&a=c
comma: { a: ['b', 'c'] } as a=b,c
auth: Used for Basic auth. Provide username and password. n8n recommends omitting this, and using helpers.httpRequestWithAuthentication(...) instead.
disableFollowRedirect: By default, n8n follows redirects. You can set this to true to prevent this from happening.
skipSslCertificateValidation: Used for calling HTTPS services without proper certificate
returnFullResponse: Instead of returning just the body, returns an object with more data in the following format: {body: body, headers: object, statusCode: 200, statusMessage: 'OK'}
encoding: n8n can detect the content type, but you can specify arrayBuffer to receive a Buffer you can read from and interact with.
Example#
For an example, refer to the Mattermost node.
Deprecation of the previous helper#
The previous helper implementation using this.helpers.request(options) used and exposed the request-promise library. This was removed in version 1.
To minimize incompatibility, n8n made a transparent conversion to another library called Axios.
If you are having issues, please report them in the Community Forums or on GitHub.
Migration guide to the new helper#
The new helper is much more robust, library agnostic, and easier to use.
New nodes should all use the new helper. You should strongly consider migrating existing custom nodes to the new helper. These are the main considerations when migrating:
Accepts url. Doesn't accept uri.
encoding: null now must be encoding: arrayBuffer.
rejectUnauthorized: false is now skipSslCertificateValidation: true
Use body according to content-type headers to clarify the payload.
resolveWithFullResponse is now returnFullResponse and has similar behavior
Item linking#
Programmatic-style nodes only
This guidance applies to programmatic-style nodes. If you're using declarative style, n8n handles paired items for you automatically.
Use n8n's item linking to access data from items that precede the current item. n8n needs to know which input item a given output item comes from. If this information is missing, expressions in other nodes may break. As a node developer, you must ensure any items returned by your node support this.
This applies to programmatic nodes (including trigger nodes). You don't need to consider item linking when building a declarative-style node. Refer to Choose your node building approach for more information on node styles.
Start by reading Item linking concepts, which provides a conceptual overview of item linking, and details of the scenarios where n8n can handle the linking automatically.
If you need to handle item linking manually, do this by setting pairedItem on each item your node returns:

// Use the pairedItem information of the incoming item
newItem = {
	"json": { . . . },
	"pairedItem": {
		"item": item.pairedItem,
		// Optional: choose the input to use
		// Set this if your node combines multiple inputs
		"input": 0
};

// Or set the index manually
newItem = {
		"json": { . . . }
		"pairedItem": {
			"item": i,
			// Optional: choose the input to use
			// Set this if your node combines multiple inputs
			"input": 0
		},
};

UX guidelines for community nodes#
Your node's UI must conform to these guidelines to be a verified community node candidate.
Credentials#
API key and sensitive credentials should always be password fields.
OAuth#
Always include the OAuth credential if available.
Node structure#
Operations to include#
Try to include CRUD operations for each resource type.
Try to include common operations in nodes for each resource. n8n uses some CRUD operations to keep the experience consistent and allow users to perform basic operations on the resource. The suggested operations are:
Create
Create or Update (Upsert)
Delete
Get
Get Many: also used when some filtering or search is available
Update
Notes:
These operations can apply to the resource itself or an entity inside of the resource (for example, a row inside a Google Sheet). When operating on an entity inside of the resource, you must specify the name of the entity in the operations name.
The naming could change depending on the node and the resource. Check the following guidelines for details.
Resource Locator#
Use a Resource Locator component whenever possible. This provides a much better UX for users. The Resource Locator Component is most often useful when you have to select a single item.
The default option for the Resource Locator Component should be From list (if available).
Consistency with other nodes#
Maintain UX consistency: n8n tries to keep its UX consistent. This means following existing UX patterns, in particular, those used in the latest new or overhauled nodes.
Check similar nodes: For example, if you're working on a database node, it's worth checking the Postgres node.
Sorting options#
You can enhance certain "Get Many" operations by providing users with sorting options.
Add sorting in a dedicated collection (below the "Options" collection). Follow the example of Airtable Record:Search.
Node functionality#
Deleting operations output#
When deleting an item (like a record or a row), return an array with a single object: {"deleted": true}. This is a confirmation for the user that the deletion was successful and the item will trigger the following node.
Simplifying output fields#
Normal nodes: 'Simplify' parameter#
When an endpoint returns data with more than 10 fields, add the "Simplify" boolean parameter to return a simplified version of the output with max 10 fields.
One of the main issues with n8n can be the size of data and the Simplify parameter limits that problem by reducing data size.
Select the most useful fields to output in the simplified node and sort them to have the most used ones at the top.
In the Simplify mode, it's often best to flatten nested fields
Display Name: Simplify
Description: Whether to return a simplified version of the response instead of the raw data
AI tool nodes: ‘Output’ parameter#
When an endpoint returns data with more than 10 fields, add the 'Output' option parameter with 3 modes.
In AI tool nodes, allow the user to be more granular and select the fields to output. The rationale is that tools may run out of context window and they can get confused by too many fields, so it's better to pass only the ones they need.
Options:
Simplified: Works the same as the "Simplify" parameter described above.
Raw: Returns all the available fields.
Selected fields: Shows a multi-option parameter for selecting the fields to add to the output and send to the AI agent. By default, this option always returns the ID of the record/entity.
Copy#
Text Case#
Use Title Case for the node name, parameters display names (labels), dropdown titles. Title Case is when you capitalize the first letter of each word, except for certain small words, such as articles and short prepositions.
Use Sentence case for node action names, node descriptions, parameters descriptions (tooltips), hints, dropdown descriptions.
Terminology#
Use the third-party service terminology: Try to use the same terminology as the service you're interfacing with (for example, Notion 'blocks', not Notion 'paragraphs').
Use the terminology used in the UI: Stick to the terminology used in the user interface of the service, rather than that used in the APIs or technical documentation (for example, in Trello you "archive" cards, but in the API they show up as "closed". In this case, you might want to use "archive").
No tech jargon: Don't use technical jargon where simple words will do. For example, use "field" instead of "key".
Consistent naming: Choose one term for something and stick to it. For example, don't mix "directory" and "folder".
Placeholders#
It's often helpful to insert examples of content in parameters placeholders. These should start with "e.g." and use camel case for the demo content in fields.
Placeholder examples to copy:
image: e.g. https://example.com/image.png
video: e.g. https://example.com/video.mp4
search term: e.g. automation
email: e.g. nathan@example.com
Twitter user (or similar): e.g. n8n
Name and last name: e.g. Nathan Smith
First name: e.g. Nathan
Last name: e.g. Smith
Operations name, action, and description#
Name: This is the name displayed in the select when the node is open on the canvas. It must use title case and doesn't have to include the resource (for example, "Delete").
Action: This is the name of the operation displayed in the panel where the user selects the node. It must be in sentence case and must include the resource (for example, "Delete record").
Description: This is the sub-text displayed below the name in the select when the node is open on the canvas. It must use sentence case and must include the resource. It can add a bit of information and use alternative words than the basic resource/operation (for example, "Retrieve a list of users").
If the operation acts on an entity that's not the Resource (for example, a row in a Google Sheet), specify that in the operation name (for example, "Delete Row").
As a general rule, is important to understand what the object of an operation is. Sometimes, the object of an Operation is the resource itself (for example, Sheet:Delete to delete a Sheet).
In other cases, the object of the operation isn't the resource, but something contained inside the resource (for example, Table:Delete rows, here the resource is the table, but what you are operating on are the rows inside of it).
Naming name#
This is the name displayed in the select when the node is open on the canvas.
Parameter: name
Case: Title Case
Naming guidelines:
Don't repeat the resource (if the resource selection is above): The resource is often displayed above the operation, so it's not necessary to repeat it in the operation (this is the case if the object of the operation is the resource itself).
For example: Sheet:Delete → No need to repeat Sheet in Delete, because n8n displays Sheet in the field above and what you're deleting is the Sheet.
Specify the resource if there's no resource selection above: In some nodes, you won't have a resource selection (because there's only one resource). In these cases, specify the resource in the operation.
For example: Delete Records → In Airtable, there's no resource selection, so it's better to specify that the Delete operation will delete records.
Specify the object of the operation if it's not the resource: Sometimes, the object of the operation isn't the resource. In these cases, specify the object in the operation as well.
For example: Table:Get Columns → Specify Columns because the resource is Table, while the object of the operation is Columns.
Naming action#
This is the name of the operation displayed in the panel where the user selects the node. * Parameter: action * Case: Sentence case
Naming guidelines:
Omit articles: To keep the text shorter, get rid of articles (a, an, the…).
correct: Update row in sheet
incorrect: Update a row in a sheet
Repeat the resource: In this case, it's okay to repeat the resource. Even if the resource is visible in the list, the user might not notice and it's useful to repeat it in the operation label.
Specify the object of the operation if it is not the resource: Same as for the operation name. In this case, you don't need to repeat the resource.
For example: Append Rows → You have to specify Rows because rows are what you're actually appending to. Don't add the resource (Sheet) since you aren't appending to the resource.
Naming description#
This is the subtext displayed below the name in the selection when the node is open on the canvas.
Parameter: description
Case: Sentence case
Naming guidelines:
If possible, add more information than that specified in the operation name
Use alternative wording to help users better understand what the operation is doing. Some people might not understand the text used in the operation (maybe English isn't their native language), and using alternative working could help them.
Vocabulary#
n8n uses a general vocabulary and some context-specific vocabulary for groups of similar applications (for example, databases or spreadsheets).
The general vocabulary takes inspiration from CRUD operations:
Clear
Delete all the contents of the resource (empty the resource).
Description: Delete all the <CHILD_ELEMENT>s inside the <RESOURCE>
Create
Create a new instance of the resource.
Description: Create a new <RESOURCE>
Create or Update
Create or update an existing instance of the resource.
Description: Create a new <RESOURCE> or update an existing one (upsert)
Delete
You can use "Delete" in two different ways:
Delete a resource:
Description: Delete a <RESOURCE> permanently (use "permanently" only if that's the case)
Delete something inside of the resource (for example, a row):
In this case, always specify the object of the operation: for example, Delete Rows or Delete Records.
Description: Delete a <CHILD_ELEMENT> permanently
Get
You can use "Get" in two different ways:
Get a resource:
Description: Retrieve a <RESOURCE>
Get an item inside of the resource (for example, records):
In this case, always specify the object of the operation: for example, Get Row or Get Record.
Description: Retrieve a <CHILD_ELEMENT> from the/a <RESOURCE>
Get Many
You can use "Get Many" in two different ways:
Get a list of resources (without filtering):
Description: Retrieve a list of <RESOURCE>s
Get a list of items inside of the resource (for example, records):
In this case, always specify the object of the operation: for example, Get Many Rows or Get Many Records.
You can omit Many: Get Many Rows can be Get Rows.
Description: List all <CHILD_ELEMENT>s in the/a <RESOURCE>
Insert or Append
Add something inside of a resource.
Use insert for database nodes.
Description: Insert <CHILD_ELEMENT>(s) in a <RESOURCE>
Insert or Update or Append or Update
Add or update something inside of a resource.
Use insert for database nodes.
Description: Insert <CHILD_ELEMENT>(s) or update an existing one(s) (upsert)
Update
You can use "Update" in two different ways:
Update a resource:
Description: Update one or more <RESOURCE>s
Update something inside of a resource (for example, a row):
In this case, always specify the object of the operation: for example, Update Rows or Update Records.
Description: Update <CHILD_ELEMENT>(s) inside a <RESOURCE>
Referring to parameter and field name#
When you need to refer to parameter names or field names in copy, wrap them in single quotation marks (for example, "Please fill the 'name' parameter).
Boolean description#
Start the description of boolean components with 'Whether...'
Errors#
General philosophy#
Errors are sources of pain for users. For this reason, n8n always wants to tell the user:
What happened: a description of the error and what went wrong.
How to solve the problem: or at least how to get unstuck and continue using n8n without problems. n8n doesn't want users to remain blocked, so use this as an opportunity to guide them to success.
Error structure in the Output panel#
Error Message - What happened#
This message explains to the user what happened, and the current issue that prevents the execution completing.
If you have the displayName of the parameter that triggered the error, include it in the error message or description (or both).
Item index: if you have the ID of the item that triggered the error, append [Item X] to the error message. For example, The ID of the release in the parameter “Release ID” for could not be found [item 2].
Avoid using words like "error", "problem", "failure", "mistake".
Error Description - How to solve or get unstuck#
The description explains to users how to solve the problem, what to change in the node configuration (if that's the case), or how to get unstuck. Here, you should guide them to the next step and unblock them.
Avoid using words like "error", "problem", "failure", "mistake".
Community node verification guidelines#
Do you want n8n to verify your node?
Consider following these guidelines while building your node if you want to submit it for verification by n8n. Any user with verified community nodes enabled can discover and install verified nodes from n8n's nodes panel.
Package source verification#
Verify that your npm package repository URL matches the expected GitHub (or other platform) repository.
Confirm that the package author / maintainer matches between npm and the repository.
Confirm that the git link in npm works and that the repository is public.
Make sure your package has proper documentation (README, usage examples, etc.).
Make sure your package license is MIT.
No external dependencies#
Ensure that your package does not include any external dependencies to keep it lightweight and easy to maintain.
Proper documentation#
Provide clear documentation, whether it’s a README on GitHub or links to relevant API documentation.
Include usage instructions, example workflows, and any necessary authentication details.
No access to environment variables or file system#
The code must not interact with environment variables or attempt to read/write files.
Pass all necessary data through node parameters.
Follow n8n best practices#
Maintain a clear and consistent coding style.
Use TypeScript and follow n8n's node development guidelines.
Ensure proper error handling and validation.
Make sure the linter passes (in other words, make sure running npx @n8n/scan-community-package n8n-nodes-PACKAGE passes).
Test a node#
This section contains information about testing your node.
There are two ways to test your node:
Manually, by running it on your own machine within a local n8n instance.
Automatically, using the linter.
You should use both methods before publishing your node.
Run your node locally#
You can test your node as you build it by running it in a local n8n instance.
Install n8n using npm:
1
npm install n8n -g



When you are ready to test your node, publish it locally:
1
2
3
# In your node directory
npm run build
npm link




Install the node into your local n8n instance:
1
2
3
# In the nodes directory within your n8n installation
# node-package-name is the name from the package.json
npm link <node-package-name>



Check your directory
Make sure you run npm link <node-name> in the nodes directory within your n8n installation. This can be:
~/.n8n/custom/
~/.n8n/<your-custom-name>: if your n8n installation set a different name using N8N_CUSTOM_EXTENSIONS.
Start n8n:
1
n8n start




Open n8n in your browser. You should see your nodes when you search for them in the nodes panel.
Node names
Make sure you search using the node name, not the package name. For example, if your npm package name is n8n-nodes-weather-nodes, and the package contains nodes named rain, sun, snow, you should search for rain, not weather-nodes.
Troubleshooting#
There's no custom directory in ~/.n8n local installation.
You have to create custom directory manually and run npm init
1
2
3
4
# In ~/.n8n directory run
mkdir custom 
cd custom 
npm init

n8n node linter#
n8n's node linter, eslint-plugin-n8n-nodes-base, statically analyzes ("lints") the source code of n8n nodes and credentials in the official repository and in community packages. The linter detects issues and automatically fixes them to help you follow best practices.
eslint-plugin-n8n-nodes-base contains a collection of rules for node files (*.node.ts), resource description files (*Description.ts), credential files (*.credentials.ts), and the package.json of a community package.
Setup#
If using the n8n node starter: Run npm install in the starter project to install all dependencies. Once the installation finishes, the linter is available to you.
If using VS Code, install the ESLint VS Code extension. For other IDEs, refer to their ESLint integrations.
Don't edit the configuration file
.eslintrc.js contains the configuration for eslint-plugin-n8n-nodes-base. Don't edit this file.
Usage#
You can use the linter in a community package or in the main n8n repository.
Linting#
In a community package, the linter runs automatically after installing dependencies and before publishing the package to npm. In the main n8n repository, the linter runs automatically using GitHub Actions whenever you push to your pull request.
In both cases, VS Code lints in the background as you work on your project. Hover over a detected issue to see a full description of the linting and a link to further information.
You can also run the linter manually:
Run npm run lint to lint and view detected issues in your console.
Run npm run lintfix to lint and automatically fix issues. The linter fixes violations of rules marked as automatically fixable.
Both commands can run in the root directory of your community package, or in /packages/nodes-base/ in the main repository.
Exceptions#
Instead of fixing a rule violation, you can also make an exception for it, so the linter doesn't flag it.
To make a lint exception from VS Code: hover over the issue and click on Quick fix (or cmd+. in macOS) and select Disable {rule} for this line. Only disable rules for a line where you have good reason to. If you think the linter is incorrectly reporting an issue, please report it in the linter repository.
To add a lint exception to a single file, add a code comment. In particular, TSLint rules may not show up in VS Code and may need to be turned off using code comments. Refer to the TSLint documentation for more guidance.
Troubleshooting#
Credentials#
Error message: 'Credentials of type "*" aren't known'#
Check that the name in the credentials array matches the name used in the property name of the credentials' class.

Editor UI#
Error message: 'There was a problem loading init data: API-Server can not be reached. It's probably down'#
Check that the names of the node file, node folder, and class match the path added to packages/nodes-base/package.json.
Check that the names used in the displayOptions property are names used by UI elements in the node.
Node icon doesn't show up in the Add Node menu and the Editor UI#
Check that the icon is in the same folder as the node.
Check that it's either in PNG or SVG format.
When the icon property references the icon file, check that it includes the logo extension (.png or .svg) and that it prefixes it with file:. For example, file:friendGrid.png or file:friendGrid.svg.
Node icon doesn't fit#
If you use an SVG file, make sure the canvas size is square. You can find instructions to change the canvas size of an SVG file using GIMP here.
If you use a PNG file, make sure that it's 60x60 pixels.
Node doesn't show up in the Add Node menu#
Check that you registered the node in the package.json file in your project.
Changes to the description properties don't show in the UI on refreshing#
Every time you change the description properties, you have to stop the current n8n process (ctrl + c) and run it again. You may also need to re-run npm link.
Linter incorrectly warning about file name case#
The node linter has rules for file names, including what case they should be. Windows users may encounter an issue when renaming files that causes the linter to continue giving warnings, even after you rename the files. This is due to a known Windows issue with changing case when renaming files.
Deploy a node#
This section contains details on how to deploy and share your node.
You can choose to:
Submit your node to the community node repository. This makes it available for everyone to use, and allows you to install and use it like any other community node. This is the only way to use custom nodes on cloud.
Install the node into your n8n instance as a private node.
Submit community nodes#
Subject to change
The standards described in this document are for the first release of the community nodes repository. These may change in future releases.
Community nodes are npm packages, hosted in the npm registry.
When building a node to submit to the community node repository, use the following resources to make sure your node setup is correct:
View the starter node and n8n's own nodes for some examples.
Refer to the documentation on building your own nodes.
Make sure your node follows the standards for community nodes.
Standards#
To make your node available to the n8n community node repository, you must:
Make sure the package name starts with n8n-nodes- or @<scope>/n8n-nodes-. For example, n8n-nodes-weather or @weatherPlugins/n8n-nodes-weather.
Include n8n-community-node-package in your package keywords.
Make sure that you add your nodes and credentials to the package.json file inside the n8n attribute. Refer to the package.json in the starter node for an example.
Check your node using the linter and test it locally to ensure it works.
Submit the package to the npm registry. Refer to npm's documentation on Contributing packages to the registry for more information.
Submit your node for verification by n8n#
n8n vets verified community nodes. Users can discover and install verified community nodes from the nodes panel in n8n. These nodes need to adhere to certain technical and UX standards and constraints.
Before submitting your node for review by n8n, you must:
Make sure that your node follows the technical guidelines for verified community nodes and that all automated checks pass. Specifically, verified community nodes aren't allowed to use any run-time dependencies.
Ensure that your node follows the UX guidelines.
Make sure that the node has appropriate documentation in the form of a README in the npm package or a related public repository.
Submit your node to npm as n8n will fetch it from there for final vetting.
If your node meets all the above requirements, click here to submit your node for verification.
Install private nodes#
You can build your own nodes and install them in your n8n instance without publishing them on npm. This is useful for nodes that you create for internal use only at your company.
Install your node in a Docker n8n instance#
If you're running n8n using Docker, you need to create a Docker image with the node installed in n8n.
Create a Dockerfile and paste the code from this Dockerfile.
Your Dockerfile should look like this:

Common issues#
Here are some common errors and issues with the Facebook Lead Ads Trigger node and steps to resolve or troubleshoot them.
Workflow only works in testing or production#
Facebook Lead Ads only allows you to register a single webhook per app. This means that every time you switch from using the testing URL to the production URL (and vice versa), Facebook Lead Ads overwrites the registered webhook URL.
You may have trouble with this if you try to test a workflow that's also active in production. Facebook Lead Ads will only send events to one of the two webhook URLs, so the other will never receive event notifications.
To work around this, you can disable your workflow when testing:
Halts production traffic
This workaround temporarily disables your production workflow for testing. Your workflow will no longer receive production traffic while it's deactivated.
Go to your workflow page.
Toggle the Active switch in the top panel to disable the workflow temporarily.
Test your workflow using the test webhook URL.
When you finish testing, toggle the Inactive toggle to enable the workflow again. The production webhook URL should resume working.

Google Drive Trigger node common issues#
Here are some common errors and issues with the Google Drive Trigger node and steps to resolve or troubleshoot them.
401 unauthorized error#
The full text of the error looks like this:
1
401 - {"error":"unauthorized_client","error_description":"Client is unauthorized to retrieve access tokens using this method, or client not authorized for any of the scopes requested."}



This error occurs when there's an issue with the credential you're using and its scopes or permissions.

For Service Account credentials:
Enable domain-wide delegation.
Make sure you add the Google Drive API as part of the domain-wide delegation configuration.
Handling more than one file change#
The Google Drive Trigger node polls Google Drive for changes at a set interval (once every minute by default).
If multiple changes to the Watch For criteria occur during the polling interval, a single Google Drive Trigger event occurs containing the changes as items. To handle this, your workflow must account for times when the data might contain more than one item.
You can use an if node or a switch node to change your workflow's behavior depending on whether the data from the Google Drive Trigger node contains a single item or multiple items.

Google Sheets Trigger node common issues#
Here are some common errors and issues with the Google Sheets Trigger node and steps to resolve or troubleshoot them.
Stuck waiting for trigger event#
When testing the Google Sheets Trigger node with the Execute step or Execute workflow buttons, the execution may appear stuck and unable to stop listening for events. If this occurs, you may need to exit the workflow and open it again to reset the canvas.
Stuck listening events often occur due to issues with your network configuration outside of n8n. Specifically, this behavior often occurs when you run n8n behind a reverse proxy without configuring websocket proxying.
To resolve this issue, check your reverse proxy configuration (Nginx, Caddy, Apache HTTP Server, Traefik, etc.) to enable websocket support.
Date and time columns are rendering as numbers#
Google Sheets can render dates and times a few different ways.
The serial number format, popularized by Lotus 1-2-3 and used my types of spreadsheet software, represents dates as a decimal number. The whole number component (the part left of the decimal) represents the number of days since December 30, 1899. The decimal portion (the part right of the decimal) represents time as a portion of a 24-hour period (for example, .5 represents noon).
To use a different format for date and time values, adjust the format in your Google Sheet Trigger node. This is available when Trigger On is set to Row Added:
Open the Google Sheet Trigger node on your canvas.
Select Add option.
Select DateTime Render.
Change DateTime Render to Formatted String.
The Google Sheets Trigger node will now format date, time, datetime, and duration fields as strings according to their number format.
The number format depends on the spreadsheet's locale settings. You can change the local by opening the spreadsheet and selecting File > Settings. In the General tab, set Locale to your preferred locale. Select Save settings to adjust the value.

Required scopes#
To use this node, you need to create an application in Slack and enable event subscriptions. Refer to Slack credentials | Slack Trigger configuration for more information.

Common issues#
Here are some common errors and issues with the Slack Trigger node and steps to resolve or troubleshoot them.
Workflow only works in testing or production#
Slack only allows you to register a single webhook per app. This means that you can't switch from using the testing URL to the production URL (and vice versa) without reconfiguring the registered webhook URL.
You may have trouble with this if you try to test a workflow that's also active in production. Slack will only send events to one of the two webhook URLs, so the other will never receive event notifications.
To work around this, you can disable your workflow when testing:
Halts production traffic
This temporarily disables your production workflow for testing. Your workflow will no longer receive production traffic while it's deactivated.
Go to your workflow page.
Toggle the Active switch in the top panel to disable the workflow temporarily.
Edit the Request URL in your the Slack Trigger configuration to use the testing webhook URL instead of the production webhook URL.
Test your workflow using the test webhook URL.
When you finish testing, edit the Request URL in your the Slack Trigger configuration to use the production webhook URL instead of the testing webhook URL.
Toggle the Inactive toggle to enable the workflow again. The production webhook URL should resume working.
Token expired#
Slack offers token rotation that you can turn on for bot and user tokens. This makes every tokens expire after 12 hours. While this may be useful for testing, n8n credentials using tokens with this enabled will fail after expiry. If you want to use your Slack credentials in production, this feature must be off.
To check if your Slack app has token rotation turned on, refer to the Slack API Documentation | Token Rotation.
If your app uses token rotation
Please note, if your Slack app uses token rotation, you can't turn it off again. You need to create a new Slack app with token rotation disabled instead.

Telegram Trigger node common issues#
Here are some common errors and issues with the Telegram Trigger node and steps to resolve or troubleshoot them.
Stuck waiting for trigger event#
When testing the Telegram Trigger node with the Execute step or Execute workflow buttons, the execution may appear stuck and unable to stop listening for events. If this occurs, you may need to exit the workflow and open it again to reset the canvas.
Stuck listening events often occur due to issues with your network configuration outside of n8n. Specifically, this behavior often occurs when you run n8n behind a reverse proxy without configuring websocket proxying.
To resolve this issue, check your reverse proxy configuration (Nginx, Caddy, Apache HTTP Server, Traefik, etc.) to enable websocket support.
Bad request: bad webhook: An HTTPS URL must be provided for webhook#
This error occurs when you run n8n behind a reverse proxy and there is a problem with your instance's webhook URL.
When running n8n behind a reverse proxy, you must configure the WEBHOOK_URL environment variable with the public URL where your n8n instance is running. For Telegram, this URL must use HTTPS.
To fix this issue, configure TLS/SSL termination in your reverse proxy. Afterward, update your WEBHOOK_URL environment variable to use the HTTPS address.
Workflow only works in testing or production#
Telegram only allows you to register a single webhook per app. This means that every time you switch from using the testing URL to the production URL (and vice versa), Telegram overwrites the registered webhook URL.
You may have trouble with this if you try to test a workflow that's also active in production. The Telegram bot will only send events to one of the two webhook URLs, so the other will never receive event notifications.
To work around this, you can either disable your workflow when testing or create separate Telegram bots for testing and production.
To create a separate telegram bot for testing, repeat the process you completed to create your first bot. Reference Telegram's bot documentation and the Telegram bot API reference for more information.
To disable your workflow when testing, try the following:
Halts production traffic
This workaround temporarily disables your production workflow for testing. Your workflow will no longer receive production traffic while it's deactivated.
Go to your workflow page.
Toggle the Active switch in the top panel to disable the workflow temporarily.
Test your workflow using the test webhook URL.
When you finish testing, toggle the Inactive toggle to enable the workflow again. The production webhook URL should resume working.

Common issues#
For common errors or issues and suggested resolution steps, refer to Common issues.
Supabase node common issues#
Here are some common errors and issues with the Supabase node and steps to resolve or troubleshoot them.
Filtering rows by metadata#
To filter rows by Supabase metadata, set the Select Type to String.
From there, you can construct a query in the Filters (String) parameter to filter the metadata using the Supabase metadata query language, inspired by the MongoDB selectors format. Access the metadata properties using the Postgres ->> arrow JSON operator like this (curly brackets denote components to fill in):
1
metadata->>{your-property}={comparison-operator}.{comparison-value}



For example to access an age property in the metadata and return results greater than or equal to 21, you could enter the following in the Filters (String) field:
1
metadata->>age=gte.21



You can combine these operators to construct more complex queries.
Can't connect to a local Supabase database when using Docker#
When you run Supabase in Docker, you need to configure the network so that n8n can connect to Supabase.
The solution depends on how you're hosting the two components.
If only Supabase is in Docker#
If only Supabase is running in Docker, the Docker Compose file used by the self-hosting guide already runs Supabase bound to the correct interfaces.
When configuring Supabase credentials, the localhost address should work without a problem (set the Host to localhost).
If Supabase and n8n are running in separate Docker containers#
If both n8n and Supabase are running in Docker in separate containers, you can use Docker networking to connect them.
Configure Supabase to listen on all interfaces by binding to 0.0.0.0 inside of the container (the official Docker compose configuration already does this this). Add both the Supabase and n8n components to the same user-defined bridge network if you aren't already managing them together in the same Docker Compose file.
When configuring Supabase credentials, use the Supabase API gateway container's name (supabase-kong by default) as the host address instead of localhost. For example, if you use the default configuration, you would set the Host to http://supabase-kong:8000.
Records are accessible through Postgres but not Supabase#
If queries for records return empty using the Supabase node, but are available through the Postgres node or with a Postgres client, there may be a conflict with Supabase's Row Level Security (RLS) policy.
Supabase always enables RLS when you create a table in a public schema with the Table Editor. When RLS is active, the API doesn't return any data with the public anon key until you create policies. This is a security measure to ensure that you only expose data you intend to.
To access data from a table with RLS enabled as the anon role, create a policy to enable the access patterns you intend to use.

Telegram node common issues#
Here are some common errors and issues with the Telegram node and steps to resolve or troubleshoot them.
Add a bot to a Telegram channel#
For a bot to send a message to a channel, you must add the bot to the channel. If you haven't added the bot to the channel, you'll see an error with a description like: Error: Forbidden: bot is not a participant of the channel.
To add a bot to a channel:
In the Telegram app, access the target channel and select the channel name.
Label the channel name as public channel.
Select Administrators > Add Admin.
Search for the bot's username and select it.
Select the checkmark on the top-right corner to add the bot to the channel.
Get the Chat ID#
You can only use @channelusername on public channels. To interact with a Telegram group, you need that group's Chat ID.
There are three ways to get that ID:
From the Telegram Trigger: Use the Telegram Trigger node in your workflow to get a Chat ID. This node can trigger on different events and returns a Chat ID on successful execution.
From your web browser: Open Telegram in a web browser and open the group chat. The group's Chat ID is the series of digits behind the letter "g." Prefix your group Chat ID with a - when you enter it in n8n.
Invite Telegram's @RawDataBot to the group: Once you add it, the bot outputs a JSON file that includes a chat object. The id for that object is the group Chat ID. Then remove the RawDataBot from your group.
Send more than 30 messages per second#
The Telegram API has a limitation of sending only 30 messages per second. Follow these steps to send more than 30 messages:
Loop Over Items node: Use the Loop Over Items node to get at most 30 chat IDs from your database.
Telegram node: Connect the Telegram node with the Loop Over Items node. Use the Expression Editor to select the Chat IDs from the Loop Over Items node.
Code node: Connect the Code node with the Telegram node. Use the Code node to wait for a few seconds before fetching the next batch of chat IDs. Connect this node with the Loop Over Items node.
You can also use this workflow.
Remove the n8n attribution from sent messages#
If you're using the node to send Telegram messages, the message automatically gets an n8n attribution appended to the end:
This message was sent automatically with n8n
To remove this attribution:
In the node's Additional Fields section, select Add Field.
Select Append n8n attribution.
Turn the toggle off.
Refer to Send Message additional fields for more information.

WhatsApp Business Cloud node common issues#
Here are some common errors and issues with the WhatsApp Business Cloud node and steps to resolve or troubleshoot them.
Bad request - please check your parameters#
This error occurs when WhatsApp Business Cloud rejects your request because of a problem with its parameters. It's common to see this when using the Send Template operation if the data you send doesn't match the format of your template.
To resolve this issue, review the parameters in your message template. Pay attention to each parameter's data type and the order they're defined in the template.
Check the data that n8n is mapping to the template parameters. If you're using expressions to set parameter values, check the input data to make sure each item resolves to a valid value. You may want to use the Edit Fields (Set) node or set a fallback value to ensure you send a value with the correct format.
Working with non-text media#
The WhatsApp Business Cloud node can work with non-text messages and media like images, audio, documents, and more.
If your operation includes a Input Data Field Name or Property Name parameter, set this to the field name itself rather than referencing the data in an expression.
For example, if you are trying to send a message with an "Image" MessageType and Take Image From set to "n8n", set Input Data Field Name to a field name like data instead of an expression like {{ $json.input.data }}.

Query Options#
The Query Submission operation supports query options:
In the main section of the Parameters panel:
Start controls the index offset to start the query from (to use the API pagination logic).
Limit sets the maximum number of records to return. Note that the API always has a limit of 30,000 returned records, whatever value you provide.
In the Query Options section, you can activate the following parameters:
Query lets you specify filter predicates in MongoDB's JSON query format. For example: {"status": "success", "_submission_time": {"$lt": "2021-11-01T01:02:03"}} queries for all submissions with the value success for the field status, and submitted before November 1st, 2021, 01:02:03.
Fields lets you specify the list of fields you want to fetch, to make the response lighter.
Sort lets you provide a list of sorting criteria in MongoDB JSON format. For example, {"status": 1, "_submission_time": -1} specifies a sort order by ascending status, and then descending submission time.
More details about these options can be found in the Formhub API docs
Submission options#
All operations that return form submission data offer options to tweak the response. These include:
Download options lets you download any attachment linked to each particular form submissions, such as pictures and videos. It also lets you select the naming pattern, and the file size to download (if available - typically for images).
Formatting options perform some reformatting as described in About reformatting.
About reformatting#
The default JSON format for KoboToolbox submission data is sometimes hard to deal with, because it's not schema-aware, and all fields are therefore returned as strings.
This node provides a lightweight opinionated reformatting logic, enabled with the Reformat? parameter, available on all operations that return form submissions: the submission query, get, and the attachment download operations.
When enabled, the reformatting:
Reorganizes the JSON into a multi-level hierarchy following the form's groups. By default, question grouping hierarchy is materialized by a / character in the field names, for example Group1/Question1. With reformatting enabled, n8n reorganizes these into Group1.Question1, as nested JSON objects.
Renames fields to trim _ (not supported by many downstream systems).
Parses all geospatial fields (Point, Line, and Area question types) into their standard GeoJSON equivalent.
Splits all fields matching any of the Multiselect Mask wildcard masks into an array. Since the multi-select fields appear as space-separated strings, they can't be guessed algorithmically, so you must provide a field naming mask. Format the masks as a comma-separated list. Lists support the * wildcard.
Converts all fields matching any of the Number Mask wildcard masks into a JSON float.
Here's a detailed example in JSON:

Common issues#
Here are some common errors and issues with the Microsoft Entra ID node and steps to resolve or troubleshoot them.
Updating the Allow External Senders and Auto Subscribe New Members options fails#
You can't update the Allow External Senders and Auto Subscribe New Members options directly after creating a new group. You must wait after creating a group before you can change the values of these options.
When designing workflows that use multiple Microsoft Entra ID nodes to first create groups and then update these options, add a Wait node between the two operations. A Wait node configured to pause for at least two seconds allows time for the group to fully initialize. After the wait, the update operation can complete without erroring.

Refer to MySQL's Connectors and APIs documentation for more information about the service.
Refer to MySQL's SELECT statement documentation for more information on writing SQL queries.
Use query parameters#
When creating a query to run on a MySQL database, you can use the Query Parameters field in the Options section to load data into the query. n8n sanitizes data in query parameters, which prevents SQL injection.
For example, you want to find a person by their email address. Given the following input data:
1
 2
 3
 4
 5
 6
 7
 8
 9
10
11
12
[
    {
        "email": "alex@example.com",
        "name": "Alex",
        "age": 21 
    },
    {
        "email": "jamie@example.com",
        "name": "Jamie",
        "age": 33 
    }
]



You can write a query like:
1
SELECT * FROM $1:name WHERE email = $2;



Then in Query Parameters, provide the field values to use. You can provide fixed values or expressions. For this example, use expressions so the node can pull the email address from each input item in turn:
1
2
// users is an example table name
users, {{ $json.email }}

MySQL node common issues#
Here are some common errors and issues with the MySQL node and steps to resolve or troubleshoot them.
Update rows by composite key#
The MySQL node's Update operation lets you to update rows in a table by providing a Column to Match On and a value. This works for tables where single column values can uniquely identify individual rows.
You can't use this pattern for tables that use composite keys, where you need multiple columns to uniquely identify a row. A example of this is MySQL's user table in the mysql database, where you need both the user and host columns to uniquely identify rows.
To update tables with composite keys, write the query manually with the Execute SQL operation instead. There, you can match on multiple values, like in this example which matches on both customer_id and product_id:
1
UPDATE orders SET quantity = 3 WHERE customer_id = 538 AND product_id = 800;



Can't connect to a local MySQL server when using Docker#
When you run either n8n or MySQL in Docker, you need to configure the network so that n8n can connect to MySQL.
The solution depends on how you're hosting the two components.
If only MySQL is in Docker#
If only MySQL is running in Docker, configure MySQL to listen on all interfaces by binding to 0.0.0.0 inside of the container (the official images are already configured this way).
When running the container, publish the port with the -p flag. By default, MySQL runs on port 3306, so your Docker command should look like this:
1
docker run -p 3306:3306 --name my-mysql -d mysql:latest



When configuring MySQL credentials, the localhost address should work without a problem (set the Host to localhost).
If only n8n is in Docker#
If only n8n is running in Docker, configure MySQL to listen on all interfaces by binding to 0.0.0.0 on the host.
If you are running n8n in Docker on Linux, use the --add-host flag to map host.docker.internal to host-gateway when you start the container. For example:
1
docker run -it --rm --add-host host.docker.internal:host-gateway --name n8n -p 5678:5678 -v n8n_data:/home/node/.n8n docker.n8n.io/n8nio/n8n



If you are using Docker Desktop, this is automatically configured for you.
When configuring MySQL credentials, use host.docker.internal as the Host address instead of localhost.
If MySQL and n8n are running in separate Docker containers#
If both n8n and MySQL are running in Docker in separate containers, you can use Docker networking to connect them.
Configure MySQL to listen on all interfaces by binding to 0.0.0.0 inside of the container (the official images are already configured this way). Add both the MySQL and n8n containers to the same user-defined bridge network.
When configuring MySQL credentials, use the MySQL container's name as the host address instead of localhost. For example, if you call the MySQL container my-mysql, you would set the Host to my-mysql.
If MySQL and n8n are running in the same Docker container#
If MySQL and n8n are running in the same Docker container, the localhost address doesn't need any special configuration. You can configure MySQL to listen on localhost and configure the Host in the MySQL credentials in n8n to use localhost.
Decimal numbers returned as strings#
By default, the MySQL node returns DECIMAL values as strings. This is done intentionally to avoid loss of precision that can occur due to limitation with the way JavaScript represents numbers. You can learn more about the decision in the documentation for the MySQL library that n8n uses.
To output decimal values as numbers instead of strings and ignore the risks in loss of precision, enable the Output Decimals as Numbers option. This will output the values as numbers instead of strings.
As an alternative, you can manually convert from the string to a decimal using the toFloat() function with toFixed() or with the Edit Fields (Set) node after the MySQL node. Be aware that you may still need to account for a potential loss of precision.

Notion node common issues#
Here are some common errors and issues with the Notion node and steps to resolve or troubleshoot them.
Relation property not displaying#
The Notion node only supports displaying the data relation property for two-way relations. When you connect two Notion databases with a two-way relationship, you can select or filter by the relation property when working with the Notion node's Database Page resource.
To enable two-way relations, edit the relation property in Notion and enable the Show on [name of related database] option to create a reverse relation. Select a name to use for the relation in the new context. The relation is now accessible in n8n when filtering or selecting.
If you need to work with Notion databases with one-way relationship, you can use the HTTP Request with your existing Notion credentials. For example, to update a one-way relationship, you can send a PATCH request to the following URL:
1
https://api.notion.com/v1/pages/<page_id>



Enable Send Body, set the Body Content Type to JSON, and set Specify Body to Using JSON. Afterward, you can enter a JSON object like the following into the JSON field:
1
 2
 3
 4
 5
 6
 7
 8
 9
10
11
{
	"properties": {
		"Account": {
			"relation": [
				{
					"id": "<your_relation_ID>"
				}
			]
		}
	}
}



Create toggle heading#
The Notion node allows you to create headings and toggles when adding blocks to Page, Database Page, or Block resources. Creating toggleable headings isn't yet supported by the Notion node itself.
You can work around this be creating a regular heading and then modifying it to enable the is_toggleable property:
Add a heading with Notion node.
Select the resource you want to add a heading to:
To add a new page with a heading, select the Page or Database Page resources with the Create operation.
To add a heading to an existing page, select the Block resource with the Append After operation.
Select Add Block and set the Type Name or ID to either Heading 1, Heading 2, or Heading 3.
Add an HTTP Request node connected to the Notion node and select the GET method.
Set the URL to https://api.notion.com/v1/blocks/<block_ID>. For example, if your added the heading to an existing page, you could use the following URL: https://api.notion.com/v1/blocks/{{ $json.results[0].id }}. If you created a new page instead of appending a block, you may need to discover the block ID by querying the page contents first.
Select Predefined Credential Type and connect your existing Notion credentials.
Add an Edit Fields (Set) node after the HTTP Request node.
Add heading_1.is_toggleable as a new Boolean field set to true. Swap heading_1 for a different heading number as necessary.
Add a second HTTP Request node after the Edit Fields (Set) node.
Set the Method to PATCH and use https://api.notion.com/v1/blocks/{{ $json.id }} as the URL value.
Select Predefined Credential Type and connect your existing Notion credentials.
Enable Send Body and set a parameter.
Set the parameter Name to heading_1 (substitute heading_1 for the heading level you are using).
Set the parameter Value to {{ $json.heading_1 }} (substitute heading_1 for the heading level you are using).
The above sequence will create a regular heading block. It will query the newly created header, add the is_toggleable property, and update the heading block.
Handle null and empty values#
You may receive a validation error when working with the Notion node if you submit fields with empty or null values. This can occur any time you populate fields from previous nodes when that data is missing.
To work around this, check for the existence of the field data before sending it to Notion or use a default value.
To check for the data before executing the Notion node, use an If node to check whether the field is unset. This allows you to use the Edit Fields (Set) node to conditionally remove the field when it doesn't have a valid value.
As an alternative, you can set a default value if the incoming data doesn't provide one.

Use this operation to create an image from a text prompt.
Enter these parameters:
Credential to connect with: Create or select an existing OpenAI credential.
Resource: Select Image.
Operation: Select Generate an Image.
Model: Select the model you want to use to generate an image.
Prompt: Enter the text description of the desired image(s). The maximum length is 1000 characters for dall-e-2 and 4000 characters for dall-e-3.
Options#
Quality: The quality of the image you generate. HD creates images with finer details and greater consistency across the image. This option is only supported for dall-e-3. Otherwise, choose Standard.
Resolution: Select the resolution of the generated images. Select 1024x1024 for dall-e-2. Select one of 1024x1024, 1792x1024, or 1024x1792 for dall-e-3 models.
Style: Select the style of the generated images. This option is only supported for dall-e-3.
Natural: Use this to produce more natural looking images.
Vivid: Use this to produce hyper-real and dramatic images.
Respond with image URL(s): Whether to return image URL(s) instead of binary file(s).
Put Output in Field: Defaults to data. Enter the name of the output field to put the binary file data in. Only available if Respond with image URL(s) is turned off.
Refer to Create image | OpenAI documentation for more information.
OpenAI Text operations#
Use this operation to message a model or classify text for violations in OpenAI. Refer to OpenAI for more information on the OpenAI node itself.
Message a Model#
Use this operation to send a message or prompt to an OpenAI model and receive a response.
Enter these parameters:
Credential to connect with: Create or select an existing OpenAI credential.
Resource: Select Text.
Operation: Select Message a Model.
Model: Select the model you want to use. If you’re not sure which model to use, try gpt-4o if you need high intelligence or gpt-4o-mini if you need the fastest speed and lowest cost. Refer to Models overview | OpenAI Platform for more information.
Messages: Enter a Text prompt and assign a Role that the model will use to generate responses. Refer to Prompt engineering | OpenAI for more information on how to write a better prompt by using these roles. Choose from one of these roles:
User: Sends a message as a user and gets a response from the model.
Assistant: Tells the model to adopt a specific tone or personality.
System: By default, the system message is "You are a helpful assistant". You can define instructions in the user message, but the instructions set in the system message are more effective. You can only set one system message per conversation. Use this to set the model's behavior or context for the next user message.
Simplify Output: Turn on to return a simplified version of the response instead of the raw data.
Output Content as JSON: Turn on to attempt to return the response in JSON format. Compatible with GPT-4 Turbo and all GPT-3.5 Turbo models newer than gpt-3.5-turbo-1106.
Options#
Frequency Penalty: Apply a penalty to reduce the model's tendency to repeat similar lines. The range is between 0.0 and 2.0.
Maximum Number of Tokens: Set the maximum number of tokens for the response. One token is roughly four characters for standard English text. Use this to limit the length of the output.
Number of Completions: Defaults to 1. Set the number of completions you want to generate for each prompt. Use carefully since setting a high number will quickly consume your tokens.
Presence Penalty: Apply a penalty to influence the model to discuss new topics. The range is between 0.0 and 2.0.
Output Randomness (Temperature): Adjust the randomness of the response. The range is between 0.0 (deterministic) and 1.0 (maximum randomness). We recommend altering this or Output Randomness (Top P) but not both. Start with a medium temperature (around 0.7) and adjust based on the outputs you observe. If the responses are too repetitive or rigid, increase the temperature. If they’re too chaotic or off-track, decrease it. Defaults to 1.0.
Output Randomness (Top P): Adjust the Top P setting to control the diversity of the assistant's responses. For example, 0.5 means half of all likelihood-weighted options are considered. We recommend altering this or Output Randomness (Temperature) but not both. Defaults to 1.0.
Refer to Message a Model | OpenAI documentation for more information.
Classify Text for Violations#
Use this operation to identify and flag content that might be harmful. OpenAI model will analyze the text and return a response containing:
flagged: A boolean field indicating if the content is potentially harmful.
categories: A list of category-specific violation flags.
category_scores: Scores for each category.
Enter these parameters:
Credential to connect with: Create or select an existing OpenAI credential.
Resource: Select Text.
Operation: Select Classify Text for Violations.
Text Input: Enter text to classify if it violates the moderation policy.
Simplify Output: Turn on to return a simplified version of the response instead of the raw data.
Options#
Use Stable Model: Turn on to use the stable version of the model instead of the latest version, accuracy may be slightly lower.
Refer to Moderations | OpenAI documentation for more information.
OpenAI node common issues#
Here are some common errors and issues with the OpenAI node and steps to resolve or troubleshoot them.
The service is receiving too many requests from you#
This error displays when you've exceeded OpenAI's rate limits.
There are two ways to work around this issue:
Split your data up into smaller chunks using the Loop Over Items node and add a Wait node at the end for a time amount that will help. Copy the code below and paste it into a workflow to use as a template.

Insufficient quota#
Quota issues
There are a number of OpenAI issues surrounding quotas, including failures when quotas have been recently topped up. To avoid these issues, ensure that there is credit in the account and issue a new API key from the API keys screen.
This error displays when your OpenAI account doesn't have enough credits or capacity to fulfill your request. This may mean that your OpenAI trial period has ended, that your account needs more credit, or that you've gone over a usage limit.
To troubleshoot this error, on your OpenAI settings page:
Select the correct organization for your API key in the first selector in the upper-left corner.
Select the correct project for your API key in the second selector in the upper-left corner.
Check the organization-level billing overview page to ensure that the organization has enough credit. Double-check that you select the correct organization for this page.
Check the organization-level usage limits page. Double-check that you select the correct organization for this page and scroll to the Usage limits section to verify that you haven't exceeded your organization's usage limits.
Check your OpenAI project's usage limits. Double-check that you select the correct project in the second selector in the upper-left corner. Select Project > Limits to view or change the project limits.
Check that the OpenAI API is operating as expected.
Balance waiting period
After topping up your balance, there may be a delay before your OpenAI account reflects the new balance.
In n8n:
check that the OpenAI credentials use a valid OpenAI API key for the account you've added money to
ensure that you connect the OpenAI node to the correct OpenAI credentials
If you find yourself frequently running out of account credits, consider turning on auto recharge in your OpenAI billing settings to automatically reload your account with credits when your balance reaches $0.
Bad request - please check your parameters#
This error displays when the request results in an error but n8n wasn't able to interpret the error message from OpenAI.
To begin troubleshooting, try running the same operation using the HTTP Request node, which should provide a more detailed error message.
Referenced node is unexecuted#
This error displays when a previous node in the workflow hasn't executed and isn't providing output that this node needs as input.
The full text of this error will tell you the exact node that isn't executing in this format:
1
An expression references the node '<node-name>', but it hasn’t been executed yet. Either change the expression, or re-wire your workflow to make sure that node executes first.



To begin troubleshooting, test the workflow up to the named node.
For nodes that call JavaScript or other custom code, determine if a node has executed before trying to use the value by calling:
1
$("<node-name>").isExecuted

n8n provides a trigger node for Postgres. You can find the trigger node docs here.
Use query parameters#
When creating a query to run on a Postgres database, you can use the Query Parameters field in the Options section to load data into the query. n8n sanitizes data in query parameters, which prevents SQL injection.
For example, you want to find a person by their email address. Given the following input data:
1
 2
 3
 4
 5
 6
 7
 8
 9
10
11
12
[
    {
        "email": "alex@example.com",
        "name": "Alex",
        "age": 21 
    },
    {
        "email": "jamie@example.com",
        "name": "Jamie",
        "age": 33 
    }
]



You can write a query like:
1
SELECT * FROM $1:name WHERE email = $2;



Then in Query Parameters, provide the field values to use. You can provide fixed values or expressions. For this example, use expressions so the node can pull the email address from each input item in turn:
1
2
// users is an example table name
{{ [ 'users', $json.email ] }}

Postgres node common issues#
Here are some common errors and issues with the Postgres node and steps to resolve or troubleshoot them.
Dynamically populate SQL IN groups with parameters#
In Postgres, you can use the SQL IN comparison construct to make comparisons between groups of values:
1
SELECT color, shirt_size FROM shirts WHERE shirt_size IN ('small', 'medium', 'large');



While you can use n8n expressions in your query to dynamically populate the values in an IN group, combining this with query parameters provides extra protection by automatically sanitizing input.
To construct an IN group query with query parameters:
Set the Operation to Execute Query.
In Options, select Query Parameters.
Use an expression to select an array from the input data. For example, {{ $json.input_shirt_sizes }}.
In the Query parameter, write your query with the IN construct with an empty set of parentheses. For example:
1
SELECT color, shirt_size FROM shirts WHERE shirt_size IN ();



Inside of the IN parentheses, use an expression to dynamically create index-based placeholders (like $1, $2, and $3) for the number of items in your query parameter array. You can do this by increasing each array index by one since the placeholder variables are 1 indexed:
1
SELECT color, shirt_size FROM shirts WHERE shirt_size IN ({{ $json.input_shirt_sizes.map((i, pos) => "$" + (pos+1)).join(', ') }});



With this technique, n8n automatically creates the correct number of prepared statement placeholders for the IN values according to the number of items in your array.
Working with timestamps and time zones#
To avoid complications with how n8n and Postgres interpret timestamp and time zone data, follow these general tips:
Use UTC when storing and passing dates: Using UTC helps avoid confusion over timezone conversions when converting dates between different representations and systems.
Set the execution timezone: Set the global timezone in n8n using either environment variables (for self-hosted) or in the settings (for n8n Cloud). You can set a workflow-specific timezone in the workflow settings.
Use ISO 8601 format: The ISO 8601 format encodes the day of the month, month, year, hour, minutes, and seconds in a standardized string. n8n passes dates between nodes as strings and uses Luxon to parse dates. If you need to cast to ISO 8601 explicitly, you can use the Date & Time node and a custom format set to the string yyyy-MM-dd'T'HH:mm:ss.
PostHog node#
Use the PostHog node to automate work in PostHog, and integrate PostHog with other applications. n8n has built-in support for a wide range of PostHog features, including creating aliases, events, and identity, as well as tracking pages.

Filter records when using the List operation#
To filter records from your Airtable base, use the Filter By Formula option. For example, if you want to return all the users that belong to the organization n8n, follow the steps mentioned below:
Select 'List' from the Operation dropdown list.
Enter the base ID and the table name in the Base ID and Table field, respectively.
Click on Add Option and select 'Filter By Formula' from the dropdown list.
Enter the following formula in the Filter By Formula field: {Organization}='n8n'.
Similarly, if you want to return all the users that don't belong to the organization n8n, use the following formula: NOT({Organization}='n8n').
Refer to the Airtable documentation to learn more about the formulas.
Airtable node common issues#
Here are some common errors and issues with the Airtable node and steps to resolve or troubleshoot them.
Forbidden - perhaps check your credentials#
This error displays when trying to perform actions not permitted by your current level of access. The full text looks something like this:
1
There was a problem loading the parameter options from server: "Forbidden - perhaps check your credentials?"



The error most often displays when the credential you're using doesn't have the scopes it requires on the resources you're attempting to manage.
Refer to the Airtable credentials and Airtables scopes documentation for more information.
Service is receiving too many requests from you#
Airtable has a hard API limit on the number of requests generated using personal access tokens.
If you send more than five requests per second per base, you will receive a 429 error, indicating that you have sent too many requests. You will have to wait 30 seconds before resuming requests. This same limit applies for sending more than 50 requests across all bases per access token.
You can find out more in the Airtable's rate limits documentation. If you find yourself running into rate limits with the Airtable node, consider implementing one of the suggestions on the handling rate limits page.

Discord node common issues#
Here are some common errors and issues with the Discord node and steps to resolve or troubleshoot them.
Add extra fields to embeds#
Discord messages can optionally include embeds, a rich preview component that can include a title, description, image, link, and more.
The Discord node supports embeds when using the Send operation on the Message resource. Select Add Embeds to set extra fields including Description, Author, Title, URL, and URL Image.
To add fields that aren't included by default, set Input Method to Raw JSON. From here, add a JSON object to the Value parameter defining the field names and values you want to include.
For example, to include footer and fields, neither of which are available using the Enter Fields Input Method, you could use a JSON object like this:
1

 3
 4
 5
 6
 7
 8

		}
	],
	"footer": {
		"text": "Some footer text here",
		"icon_url": "https://i.imgur.com/AfFp7pu.png"
	}
}



You can learn more about embeds in Using Webhooks and Embeds | Discord.
If you experience issues when working with embeds with the Discord node, you can use the HTTP Request with your existing Discord credentials to POST to the following URL:

To mention a user, you need to know the Discord user's user ID. Keep in mind that the user ID is different from the user's display name. Similarly, you need a channel ID to link to a specific channel.
You can learn how to enable developer mode and copy the user or channel IDs in Discord's documentation on finding User/Server/Message IDs.
Once you have the user or channel ID, you can format your message with the following syntax:
User: <@USER_ID>
Channel: <#CHANNEL_ID>
Role: <@&ROLE_ID>

Google Drive node common issues#
Here are some common errors and issues with the Google Drive node and steps to resolve or troubleshoot them.
Google hasn't verified this app#
If using the OAuth authentication method, you might see the warning Google hasn't verified this app. To avoid this, you can create OAuth credentials from the same account you want to authenticate.
If you need to use credentials generated by another account (by a developer or another third party), follow the instructions in Google Cloud documentation | Authorization errors: Google hasn't verified this app.
Google Cloud app becoming unauthorized#
For Google Cloud apps with Publishing status set to Testing and User type set to External, consent and tokens expire after seven days. Refer to Google Cloud Platform Console Help | Setting up your OAuth consent screen for more information. To resolve this, reconnect the app in the n8n credentials modal.
Google Drive OAuth error#
If using the OAuth authentication method, you may see an error indicating that you can't sign in because the app doesn't meet Google's expectations for keeping apps secure.
Most often, the actual cause of this issue is that the URLs don't match between Google's OAuth configuration and n8n. To avoid this, start by reviewing any links included in Google's error message. This will contain details about the exact error that occurred.
If you are self-hostin n8n, check the n8n configuration items used to construct external URLs. Verify that the N8N_EDITOR_BASE_URL and WEBHOOK_URL environment variables use fully qualified domains.
Get recent files from Google Drive#
To retrieve recent files from Google Drive, you need to sort files by modification time. To do this, you need to search for existing files and retrieve their modification times. Next you can sort the files to find the most recent file and use another Google Drive node target the file by ID.
The process looks like this:
Add a Google Drive node to your canvas.
Select the File/Folder resource and the Search operation.
Enable Return All to sort through all files.
Set the What to Search filter to Files.
In the Options, set the Fields to All.
Connect a Sort node to the output of the Google Drive node.
Choose Simple sort type.
Enter modifiedTime as the Field Name in the Fields To Sort By section.
Choose Descending sort order.
Add a Limit node to the output of the Sort node.
Set Max Items to 1 to keep the most recent file.
Connect another Google Drive node to the output of the Limit node.
Select File as the Resource and the operation of your choice.
In the File selection, choose By ID.
Select Expression and enter {{ $json.id }} as the expression.

Google Sheets node common issues#
Here are some common errors and issues with the Google Sheets node and steps to resolve or troubleshoot them.
Append an array#
To insert an array of data into Google Sheets, you must convert the array into a valid JSON (key, value) format.
To do so, consider using:
The Split Out node.
The AI Transform node. For example, try entering something like:
1
Convert 'languages' array to JSON (key, value) pairs.



The Code node.
Column names were updated after the node's setup#
You'll receive this error if the Google Sheet's column names have changed since you set up the node.
To refresh the column names, re-select Mapping Column Mode. This should prompt the node to fetch the column names again.

How to control which custom fields to fetch for a user#
There are three different ways to control which custom fields to retrieve when getting a user's information. Use the Custom Fields parameter to select one of the following:
Don't Include: Doesn't include any custom fields.
Custom: Includes the custom fields from schemas in Custom Schema Names or IDs.
Include All: Include all the fields associated with the user.
To include custom fields, follow these steps:
Select Custom from the Custom Fields dropdown list.
Select the schema names you want to include in the Custom Schema Names or IDs dropdown list.

Integrations#
n8n calls integrations nodes.
Nodes are the building blocks of workflows in n8n. They're an entry point for retrieving data, a function to process data, or an exit for sending data. The data process includes filtering, recomposing, and changing data. There can be one or several nodes for your API, service or app. You can connect multiple nodes, which allows you to create complex workflows.
Built-in nodes#
n8n includes a collection of built-in integrations. Refer to Built-in nodes for documentation on all n8n's built-in nodes.
Community nodes#
As well as using the built-in nodes, you can also install community-built nodes. Refer to Community nodes for more information.
Credential-only nodes and custom operations#
One of the most complex parts of setting up API calls is managing authentication. n8n provides credentials support for operations and services beyond those supported by built-in nodes.
Custom operations for existing nodes: n8n supplies hundreds of nodes to create workflows that link multiple products. However, some nodes don't include all the possible operations supported by a product's API. You can work around this by making a custom API call using the HTTP Request node.
Credential-only nodes: n8n includes credential-only nodes. These are integrations where n8n supports setting up credentials for use in the HTTP Request node, but doesn't provide a standalone node. You can find a credential-only node in the nodes panel, as you would for any other integration.
Refer to Custom operations for more information.
Generic integrations#
If you need to connect to a service where n8n doesn't have a node, or a credential-only node, you can still use the HTTP Request node. Refer to the node page for details on how to set up authentication and create your API call.
Where to go next#
If you want to create your own node, head over to the Creating Nodes section.
Check out Community nodes to learn about installing and managing community-built nodes.
If you'd like to learn more about the different nodes in n8n, their functionalities and example usage, check out n8n's node libraries: Core nodes, Actions, and Triggers.
If you'd like to learn how to add the credentials for the different nodes, head over to the Credentials section.
Built-in integrations#
This section contains the node library: reference documentation for every built-in node in n8n, and their credentials.
Node operations: Triggers and Actions#
When you add a node to a workflow, n8n displays a list of available operations. An operation is something a node does, such as getting or sending data.
There are two types of operation:
Triggers start a workflow in response to specific events or conditions in your services. When you select a Trigger, n8n adds a trigger node to your workflow, with the Trigger operation you chose pre-selected. When you search for a node in n8n, Trigger operations have a bolt icon .
Actions are operations that represent specific tasks within a workflow, which you can use to manipulate data, perform operations on external systems, and trigger events in other systems as part of your workflows. When you select an Action, n8n adds a node to your workflow, with the Action operation you chose pre-selected.
Core nodes#
Core nodes can be actions or triggers. Whereas most nodes connect to a specific external service, core nodes provide functionality such as logic, scheduling, or generic API calls.
Cluster nodes#
Cluster nodes are node groups that work together to provide functionality in an n8n workflow. Instead of using a single node, you use a root node and one or more sub-nodes that extend the functionality of the node.

Credentials#
External services need a way to identify and authenticate users. This data can range from an API key over an email/password combination to a long multi-line private key. You can save these in n8n as credentials.
Nodes in n8n can then request that credential information. As another layer of security, only node types with specific access rights can access the credentials.
To make sure that the data is secure, it gets saved to the database encrypted. n8n uses a random personal encryption key, which it automatically generates on the first run of n8n and then saved under ~/.n8n/config.
To learn more about creating, managing, and sharing credentials, refer to Manage credentials.
Community nodes#
n8n supports custom nodes built by the community. Refer to Community nodes for guidance on installing and using these nodes.
For help building your own custom nodes, and publish them to npm, refer to Creating nodes for more information.
Core nodes library#
This section provides information about n8n's core nodes.
Activation Trigger node#
The Activation Trigger node gets triggered when an event gets fired by n8n or a workflow.
Warning
n8n has deprecated the Activation Trigger node and replaced it with two new nodes: the n8n Trigger node and the Workflow Trigger node. For more details, check out the entry in the breaking changes page.
Keep in mind
If you want to use the Activation Trigger node for a workflow, add the node to the workflow. You don't have to create a separate workflow.
The Activation Trigger node gets triggered for the workflow that it gets added to. You can use the Activation Trigger node to trigger a workflow to notify the state of the workflow.
Node parameters#
Events
Activation: Run when the workflow gets activated
Start: Run when n8n starts or restarts
Update: Run when the workflow gets saved while it's active
Aggregate#
Use the Aggregate node to take separate items, or portions of them, and group them together into individual items.
Node parameters#
To begin using the node, select the Aggregate you'd like to use:
Individual Fields: Aggregate individual fields separately.
All Item Data: Aggregate all item data into a single list.
Individual Fields#
Input Field Name: Enter the name of the field in the input data to aggregate together.
Rename Field: This toggle controls whether to give the field a different name in the aggregated output data. Turn this on to add a different field name. If you're aggregating multiple fields, you must provide new output field names. You can't leave multiple fields undefined.
Output Field Name: This field is displayed when you turn on Rename Field. Enter the field name for the aggregated output data.
Refer to Node options for more configuration options.
All Item Data#
Put Output in Field: Enter the name of the field to output the data in.
Include: Select which fields to include in the output. Choose from:
All fields: The output includes data from all fields with no further parameters.
Specified Fields: If you select this option, enter a comma-separated list of fields the output should include data from in the Fields To Include parameter. The output will include only the fields in this list.
All Fields Except: If you select this option, enter a comma-separated list of fields the output should exclude data from in the Fields To Exclude parameter. The output will include all fields not in this list.
Refer to Node options for more configuration options.
Node options#
You can further configure this node using these Options:
Disable Dot Notation: The node displays this toggle when you select the Individual Fields Aggregate. It controls whether to disallow referencing child fields using parent.child in the field name (turned on), or allow it (turned off, default).
Merge Lists: The node displays this toggle when you select the Individual Fields Aggregate. Turn it on if the field to aggregate is a list and you want to output a single flat list rather than a list of lists.
Include Binaries: The node displays this toggle for both Aggregate types. Turn it on if you want to include binary data from the input in the new output.
Keep Missing And Null Values: The node displays this toggle when you select the Individual Fields Aggregate. Turn it on to add a null (empty) entry in the output list when there is a null or missing value in the input. If turned off, the output ignores null or empty values.
AI Transform#

Guidance on Handling dates and Querying JSON
A growing collection of examples in the Cookbook
Examples and templates
For usage examples and templates to help you get started, refer to n8n's Code integrations page.
Function and Function Item nodes
The Code node replaces the Function and Function Item nodes from version 0.198.0. If you're using an older version of n8n, you can still view the Function node documentation and Function Item node documentation.
Usage#
How to use the Code node.
Choose a mode#
There are two modes:
Run Once for All Items: this is the default. When your workflow runs, the code in the code node executes once, regardless of how many input items there are.
Run Once for Each Item: choose this if you want your code to run for every input item.
JavaScript#
The Code node supports Node.js.
Supported JavaScript features#
The Code node supports:
Promises. Instead of returning the items directly, you can return a promise which resolves accordingly.
Writing to your browser console using console.log. This is useful for debugging and troubleshooting your workflows.
External libraries#
If you self-host n8n, you can import and use built-in and external npm modules in the Code node. To learn how to enable external modules, refer to the Enable modules in Code node guide.
If you use n8n Cloud, you can't import external npm modules. n8n makes two modules available for you:
crypto Node.js module
moment npm package
Built-in methods and variables#
n8n provides built-in methods and variables for working with data and accessing n8n data. Refer to Built-in methods and variables for more information.
The syntax to use the built-in methods and variables is $variableName or $methodName(). Type $ in the Code node or expressions editor to see a list of suggested methods and variables.
Keyboard shortcuts#
The Code node editing environment supports time-saving and useful keyboard shortcuts for a range of operations from autocompletion to code-folding and using multiple-cursors. A full list can be found in the list of keyboard shortcuts.
Python#
n8n added Python support in version 1.0. It doesn't include a Python executable. Instead, n8n provides Python support using Pyodide, which is a port of CPython to WebAssembly. This limits the available Python packages to the Packages included with Pyodide. n8n downloads the package automatically the first time you use it.
Slower than JavaScript
The Code node takes longer to process Python than JavaScript. This is due to the extra compilation steps.
Built-in methods and variables#
n8n provides built-in methods and variables for working with data and accessing n8n data. Refer to Built-in methods and variables for more information.
The syntax to use the built-in methods and variables is _variableName or _methodName(). Type _ in the Code node to see a list of suggested methods and variables.
Keyboard shortcuts#
The Code node editing environment supports time-saving and useful keyboard shortcuts for a range of operations from autocompletion to code-folding and using multiple-cursors. A full list can be found in the list of keyboard shortcuts.
File system and HTTP requests#
You can't access the file system or make HTTP requests. Use the following nodes instead:
Read/Write File From Disk
HTTP Request
Coding in n8n#
There are two places where you can use code in n8n: the Code node and the expressions editor. When using either area, there are some key concepts you need to know, as well as some built-in methods and variables to help with common tasks.
Key concepts#
When working with the Code node, you need to understand the following concepts:
Data structure: understand the data you receive in the Code node, and requirements for outputting data from the node.
Item linking: learn how data items work, and how to link to items from previous nodes. You need to handle item linking in your code when the number of input and output items doesn't match.
Built-in methods and variables#
n8n includes built-in methods and variables. These provide support for:
Accessing specific item data
Accessing data about workflows, executions, and your n8n environment
Convenience variables to help with data and time
Refer to Built-in methods and variables for more information.
Use AI in the Code node#
Feature availability
AI assistance in the Code node is available to Cloud users. It isn't available in self-hosted n8n.
AI generated code overwrites your code
If you've already written some code on the Code tab, the AI generated code will replace it. n8n recommends using AI as a starting point to create your initial code, then editing it as needed.
To use ChatGPT to generate code in the Code node:
In the Code node, set Language to JavaScript.
Select the Ask AI tab.
Write your query.
Select Generate Code. n8n sends your query to ChatGPT, then displays the result in the Code tab.

Code node common issues#
Here are some common errors and issues with the Code node and steps to resolve or troubleshoot them.
Code doesn't return items properly#
This error occurs when the code in your Code node doesn't return data in the expected format.
In n8n, all data passed between nodes is an array of objects. Each of these objects wraps another object with the json key:
1
2
3
4
5
6
7
[
  {
    "json": {
	  // your data goes here
	}
  }
]



To troubleshoot this error, check the following:
Read the data structure to understand the data you receive in the Code node and the requirements for outputting data from the node.
Understand how data items work and how to connect data items from previous nodes with item linking.
A 'json' property isn't an object#
This error occurs when the Code node returns data where the json key isn't pointing to an object.
This may happen if you set json to a different data structure, like an array:
1
2
3
4
5
6
7
[
  {
    "json": [
	  // Setting `json` to an array like this will produce an error
	]
  }
]



To resolve this, ensure that the json key references an object in your return data:
1
2
3
4
5
6
7
[
  {
    "json": {
	  // Setting `json` to an object as expected
	}
  }
]



Code doesn't return an object#
This error may occur when your Code node doesn't return anything or if it returns an unexpected result.
To resolve this, ensure that your Code node returns the expected data structure:
1
2
3
4
5
6
7
[
  {
    "json": {
	  // your data goes here
	}
  }
]



This error may also occur if the code you provided returns 'undefined' instead of the expected result. In that case, ensure that the data you are referencing in your Code node exists in each execution and that it has the structure your code expects.
'import' and 'export' may only appear at the top level#
This error occurs if you try to use import or export in the Code node. These aren't supported by n8n's JavaScript sandbox. Instead, use the require function to load modules.
To resolve this issue, try changing your import statements to use require:
1
2
3
4
// Original code:
// import express from "express";
// New code:
const express = require("express");



Cannot find module '<module>'#
This error occurs if you try to use require in the Code node and n8n can't find the module.
Only for self-hosted
n8n doesn't support importing modules in the Cloud version.
If you're self-hosting n8n, follow these steps:
Install the module into your n8n environment.
If you are running n8n with npm, install the module in the same environment as n8n.
If you are running n8n with Docker, you need to extend the official n8n image with a custom image that includes your module.
Set the NODE_FUNCTION_ALLOW_BUILTIN and NODE_FUNCTION_ALLOW_EXTERNAL environment variables to allow importing modules.
Using global variables#
Sometimes you may wish to set and retrieve simple global data related to a workflow across and within executions. For example, you may wish to include the date of the previous report when compiling a report with a list of project updates.
To set, update, and retrieve data directly to a workflow, use the static data functions within your code. You can manage data either globally or tied to specific nodes.
Compare Datasets#
The Compare Datasets node helps you compare data from two input streams.
Node parameters#
Decide which fields to compare. In Input A Field, enter the name of the field you want to use from input stream A. In Input B Field, enter the name of the field you want to use from input stream B.
Optional: You can compare by multiple fields. Select Add Fields to Match to set up more comparisons.
Choose how to handle differences between the datasets. In When There Are Differences, select one of the following:
Use Input A Version to treat input stream A as the source of truth.
Use Input B Version to treat input stream B as the source of truth.
Use a Mix of Versions to use different inputs for different fields.
Use Prefer to select either Input A Version or Input B Version as the main source of truth.
Enter input fields that are exceptions to For Everything Except to pull from the other input source. To add multiple input fields, enter a comma-separated list.
Include Both Versions to include both input streams in the output, which may make the structure more complex.
Decide whether to use Fuzzy Compare. When turned on, the comparison will tolerate small type differences when comparing fields. For example, the number 3 and the string 3 are treated as the same with Fuzzy Compare turned on, but wouldn't be treated the same with it turned off.
Understand item comparison#
Item comparison is a two stage process:
n8n checks if the values of the fields you selected to compare match across both inputs.
If the fields to compare match, n8n then compares all fields within the items, to determine if the items are the same or different.
Node options#
Use the node Options to refine your comparison or tweak comparison behavior.
Fields to Skip Comparing#
Enter field names that you want to ignore in the comparison.
For example, if you compare the two datasets below using person.language as the Fields to Match, n8n returns them as different. If you add person.name to Fields to Skip Comparing, n8n returns them as matching.

Every message to the Chat Trigger executes your workflow. This means that one conversation where a user sends 10 messages uses 10 executions from your execution allowance. Check your payment plan for details of your allowance.
Manual Chat trigger
This node replaces the Manual Chat Trigger node from version 1.24.0.
Node parameters#
Make Chat Publicly Available#
Set whether the chat should be publicly available (turned on) or only available through the manual chat interface (turned off).
Leave this turned off while you're building the workflow. Turn it on when you're ready to activate the workflow and allow users to access the chat.
Mode#
Choose how users access the chat. Select from:
Hosted Chat: Use n8n's hosted chat interface. Recommended for most users because you can configure the interface using the node options and don't have to do any other setup.
Embedded Chat: This option requires you to create your own chat interface. You can use n8n's chat widget or build your own. Your chat interface must call the webhook URL shown in Chat URL in the node.
Authentication#
Choose whether and how to restrict access to the chat. Select from:
None: The chat doesn't use authentication. Anyone can use the chat.
Basic Auth: The chat uses basic authentication.
Select or create a Credential for Basic Auth with a username and password. All users must use the same username and password.
n8n User Auth: Only users logged in to an n8n account can use the chat.
Initial Message(s)#
This parameter's only available if you're using Hosted Chat. Use it to configure the message the n8n chat interface displays when the user arrives on the page.
Node options#
Available options depend on the chat mode.
Hosted chat options#
Allowed Origin (CORS)#
Set the origins that can access the chat URL. Enter a comma-separated list of URLs allowed for cross-origin non-preflight requests.
Use * (default) to allow all origins.
Input Placeholder, Title, and Subtitle#
Enter the text for these elements in the chat interface.

Load Previous Session#
Select whether to load chat messages from a previous chat session.
If you select any option other than Off, you must connect the Chat trigger and the Agent you're using to a memory sub-node. The memory connector on the Chat trigger appears when you set Load Previous Session to From Memory. n8n recommends connecting both the Chat trigger and Agent to the same memory sub-node, as this ensures a single source of truth for both nodes.
View screenshot

Response Mode#
Use this option when building a workflow with steps after the agent or chain that's handling the chat. Choose from:
When Last Node Finishes: The Chat Trigger node returns the response code and the data output from the last node executed in the workflow.
Using 'Respond to Webhook' Node: The Chat Trigger node responds as defined in the Respond to Webhook node.
Require Button Click to Start Chat#
Set whether to display a New Conversation button on the chat interface (turned on) or not (turned off).

Set the chat response manually#
You need to manually set the chat response when you don't want to directly send the output of an Agent or Chain node to the user. Instead, you want to take the output of an Agent or Chain node and modify it or do something else with it before sending it back to the user.
In a basic workflow, the Agent and Chain nodes output a parameter named either output or text, and the Chat trigger sends the value of this parameter to the user as the chat response.
If you need to manually create the response sent to the user, you must create a parameter named either text or output. If you use a different parameter name, the Chat trigger sends the entire object as its response, not just the value.
Chat Trigger node common issues#
Here are some common errors and issues with the Chat Trigger node and steps to resolve or troubleshoot them.
Pass data from a website to an embedded Chat Trigger node#
When embedding the Chat Trigger node in a website, you might want to pass extra information to the Chat Trigger. For example, passing a user ID stored in a site cookie.
To do this, use the metadata field in the JSON object you pass to the createChat function in your embedded chat window:
1
2
3
4
5
6
createChat({
	webhookUrl: 'YOUR_PRODUCTION_WEBHOOK_URL',
	metadata: {
		'YOUR_KEY': 'YOUR_DATA'
	};
});



The metadata field can contain arbitrary data that will appear in the Chat Trigger output alongside other output data. From there, you can query and process the data from downstream nodes as usual using n8n's data processing features.
Chat Trigger node doesn't fetch previous messages#
When you configure a Chat Trigger node, you might experience problems fetching previous messages if you aren't careful about how you configure session loading. This often manifests as a workflow could not be started! error.
In Chat Triggers, the Load Previous Session option retrieves previous chat messages for a session using the sessionID. When you set the Load Previous Session option to From memory, it's almost always best to connect the same memory node to both the Chat Trigger and the Agent in your workflow:
In your Chat Trigger node, set the Load Previous Session option to From Memory. This is only visible if you've made the chat publicly available.
Attach a Simple Memory node to the Memory connector.
Attach the same Simple Memory node to Memory connector of your Agent.
In the Simple Memory node, set Session ID to Connected Chat Trigger Node.
One instance where you may want to attach separate memory nodes to your Chat Trigger and the Agent is if you want to set the Session ID in your memory node to Define below.
If you're retrieving the session ID from an expression, the same expression must work for each of the nodes attached to it. If the expression isn't compatible with each of the nodes that need memory, you might need to use separate memory nodes so you can customize the expression for the session ID on a per-node basis.

The node relies on the timezone setting. n8n uses either:
The workflow timezone, if set. Refer to Workflow settings for more information.
The n8n instance timezone, if the workflow timezone isn't set. The default is America/New York for self-hosted instances. n8n Cloud tries to detect the instance owner's timezone when they sign up, falling back to GMT as the default. Self-hosted users can change the instance setting using Environment variables. Cloud admins can change the instance timezone in the Admin dashboard.

Edit Fields (Set)#
Use the Edit Fields node to set workflow data. This node can set new data as well as overwrite data that already exists. This node is crucial in workflows which expect incoming data from previous nodes, such as when inserting values to Google Sheets or databases.
Node parameters#
These are the settings and options available in the Edit Fields node.
Mode#
You can either use Manual Mapping to edit fields using the GUI or JSON Output to write JSON that n8n adds to the input data.
Fields to Set#
If you select Mode > Manual Mapping, you can configure the fields by dragging and dropping values from INPUT.
The default behavior when you drag a value is:
n8n sets the value's name as the field name.
The field value contains an expression which accesses the value.
If you don't want to use expressions:
Hover over a field. n8n displays the Fixed | Expressions toggle.
Select Fixed.
You can do this for both the name and value of the field.

Keep Only Set Fields#
Enable this to discard any input data that you don't use in Fields to Set.
Include in Output#
Choose which input data to include in the node's output data.
Node options#
Use these options to customize the behavior of the node.
Include Binary Data#
If the input data includes binary data, choose whether to include it in the Edit Fields node's output data.
Ignore Type Conversion Errors#
Manual Mapping only.
Enabling this allows n8n to ignore some data type errors when mapping fields.
Support Dot Notation#
By default, n8n supports dot notation.
For example, when using manual mapping, the node follows the dot notation for the Name field. That means if you set the name in the Name field as number.one and the value in the Value field as 20, the resulting JSON is:
1
{ "number": { "one": 20} }



You can prevent this behavior by selecting Add Option > Support Dot Notation, and setting the Dot Notion field to off. Now the resulting JSON is:
1
{ "number.one": 20 }

Edit Image#
Use the Edit Image node to manipulate and edit images.
Dependencies
If you aren't running n8n on Docker, you need to install GraphicsMagick.
You need to use a node such as the Read/Write Files from Disk node or the HTTP Request node to pass the image file as a data property to the Edit Image node.

Force Reconnect Every Minutes#
Set an interval in minutes to force reconnection.
Error Trigger node#
You can use the Error Trigger node to create error workflows. When another linked workflow fails, this node gets details about the failed workflow and the errors, and runs the error workflow.
Usage#
Create a new workflow, with the Error Trigger as the first node.
Give the workflow a name, for example Error Handler.
Select Save.
In the workflow where you want to use this error workflow:
Select Options  > Settings.
In Error workflow, select the workflow you just created. For example, if you used the name Error Handler, select Error handler.
Select Save. Now, when this workflow errors, the related error workflow runs.
Note the following:
If a workflow uses the Error Trigger node, you don't have to activate the workflow.
If a workflow contains the Error Trigger node, by default, the workflow uses itself as the error workflow.
You can't test error workflows when running workflows manually. The Error Trigger only runs when an automatic workflow errors.

Evaluation node#
The Evaluation node performs various operations related to evaluations to validate your AI workflow reliability. You can use the Evaluation node to conditionally execute logic based on whether the workflow is under evaluation, to write evaluation outcomes back to a Google Sheet dataset, or to log scoring metrics for your evaluation performance to n8n's evaluations tab.
Credentials
The Evaluation node's Set Outputs operation uses Google Sheets to record evaluation outcomes. To use that operation, you must configure a Google Sheets credential.
Operations#
The Evaluation node offers the following operations:
Set Outputs: Write the results of an evaluation back to a Google Sheet dataset.
Set Metrics: Record metrics scoring the evaluation performance to n8n's Evaluations tab.
Check If Evaluating: Branches the workflow execution logic depending on whether the current execution is an evaluation.
The parameters and options available depend on the operation you select.
Set Outputs#
The Set Outputs operation has the following parameters:
Credential to connect with: Create or select an existing Google Sheets credentials.
Document Containing Dataset: Choose the spreadsheet document you want to write the evaluation results to. Usually this is the same document you select in the Evaluation Trigger node.
Select From list to choose the spreadsheet title from the dropdown list, By URL to enter the url of the spreadsheet, or By ID to enter the spreadsheetId.
You can find the spreadsheetId in a Google Sheets URL: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/spreadsheetId/edit#gid=0.
Sheet Containing Dataset: Choose the sheet you want to write the evaluation results to. Usually this is the same sheet you select in the Evaluation Trigger node.
Select From list to choose the sheet title from the dropdown list, By URL to enter the url of the sheet, By ID to enter the sheetId, or By Name to enter the sheet title.
You can find the sheetId in a Google Sheets URL: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/aBC-123_xYz/edit#gid=sheetId.
You define the items to write to the Google Sheet in the Outputs section. For each output, you set the following:
Name: The Google Sheet column name to write the evaluation results to.
Value: The value to write to the Google Sheet.
Set Metrics#
The Set Metrics operation includes a Metrics to Return section where you define the metrics to record and track for your evaluations. You can see the metric results in your workflow's Evaluations tab.
For each metric you wish to record, you set the following details:
Name: The name to use for the metric.
Value: The numeric value to record. Once you run your evaluation, you can drag and drop values from previous nodes here. Metric values must be numeric.
Check If Evaluating#
The Check If Evaluating operation does not have any parameters. This operation provides branching output connectors so that you can conditionally execute logic depending on whether the current execution is an evaluation or not.

n8n provides an app node for evaluations. You can find the node docs here.
For common questions or issues and suggested solutions, refer to the evaluations tips and common issues page.
Execute Command#
The Execute Command node runs shell commands on the host machine that runs n8n.
Which shell runs the command?
This node executes the command in the default shell of the host machine. For example, cmd on Windows and zsh on macOS.
If you run n8n with Docker, your command will run in the n8n container and not the Docker host.
Not available on Cloud
This node isn't available on n8n Cloud.
Node parameters#
Configure the node using the following parameters.
Execute Once#
Choose whether you want the node to execute only once (turned on) or once for every item it receives as input (turned off).
Command#
Enter the command to execute on the host machine. Refer to sections below for examples of running multiple commands and cURL commands.
Run multiple commands#
Use one of two methods to run multiple commands in one Execute Command node:
Enter each command on one line separated by &&. For example, you can combine the change directory (cd) command with the list (ls) command using &&.
1
cd bin && ls




Enter each command on a separate line. For example, you can write the list (ls) command on a new line after the change directory (cd) command.
1
2
cd bin
ls



Run cURL command#
You can also use the HTTP Request node to make a cURL request.
If you want to run the curl command in the Execute Command node, you will have to build a Docker image based on the existing n8n image. The default n8n Docker image uses Alpine Linux. You will have to install the curl package.
Create a file named Dockerfile.
Add the below code snippet to the Dockerfile.
1
2
3
4
FROM docker.n8n.io/n8nio/n8n
USER root
RUN apk --update add curl
USER node




In the same folder, execute the command below to build the Docker image.
1
docker build -t n8n-curl




Replace the Docker image you used before. For example, replace docker.n8n.io/n8nio/n8n with n8n-curl.
Run the newly created Docker image. You'll now be able to execute ssh using the Execute Command Node.
Execute Command node common issues#
Here are some common errors and issues with the Execute Command node and steps to resolve or troubleshoot them.
Command failed: <command> /bin/sh: <command>: not found#
This error occurs when the shell environment can't find one of the commands in the Command parameter.
To fix this error, review the following:
Check that the command and its arguments don't have typos in the Command parameter.
Check that the command is in the PATH of the user running n8n.
If you are running n8n with Docker, check if the command is available within the container by trying to run it manually. If your command isn't included in the container, you might have to extend the official n8n image with a custom image that includes your command.
If n8n is already running:
1
2
3
4
# Find n8n's container ID, it will be the first column
docker ps | grep n8n
# Try to execute the command within the running container
docker container exec <container_ID> <command_to_run>



If n8n isn't running:
1
2
3
# Start up a new container that runs the command instead of n8n
# Use the same image and tag that you use to run n8n normally
docker run -it --rm --entrypoint /bin/sh docker.n8n.io/n8nio/n8n -c <command_to_run>



Error: stdout maxBuffer length exceeded#
This error happens when your command returns more output than the Execute Command node is able to process at one time.
To avoid this error, reduce output your command produces. Check your command's manual page or documentation to see if there are flags to limit or filter output. If not, you may need to pipe the output to another command to remove unneeded info.
Execute Sub-workflow#
Use the Execute Sub-workflow node to run a different workflow on the host machine that runs n8n.
Node parameters#
Source#
Select where the node should get the sub-workflow's information from:
Database: Select this option to load the workflow from the database by ID. You must also enter either:
From list: Select the workflow from a list of workflows available to your account.
Workflow ID: Enter the ID for the workflow. The URL of the workflow contains the ID after /workflow/. For example, if the URL of a workflow is https://my-n8n-acct.app.n8n.cloud/workflow/abCDE1f6gHiJKL7, the Workflow ID is abCDE1f6gHiJKL7.
Local File: Select this option to load the workflow from a locally saved JSON file. You must also enter:
Workflow Path: Enter the path to the local JSON workflow file you want the node to execute.
Parameter: Select this option to load the workflow from a parameter. You must also enter:
Workflow JSON: Enter the JSON code you want the node to execute.
URL: Select this option to load the workflow from a URL. You must also enter:
Workflow URL: Enter the URL you want to load the workflow from.
Workflow Inputs#
If you select a sub-workflow using the database and From list options, the sub-workflow's input items will automatically display, ready for you to fill in or map values.
You can optionally remove requested input items, in which case the sub-workflow receives null as the item's value. You can also enable Attempt to convert types to try to automatically convert data to the sub-workflow item's requested type.
Input items won't appear if the sub-workflow's Workflow Input Trigger node uses the "Accept all data" input data mode.
Mode#
Use this parameter to control the execution mode for the node. Choose from these options:
Run once with all items: Pass all input items into a single execution of the node.
Run once for each item: Execute the node once for each input item in turn.
Node options#
This node includes one option: Wait for Sub-Workflow Completion. This lets you control whether the main workflow should wait for the sub-workflow's completion before moving on to the next step (turned on) or whether the main workflow should continue without waiting (turned off).

Set up and use a sub-workflow#
This section walks through setting up both the parent workflow and sub-workflow.
Create the sub-workflow#
Create a new workflow.
Create sub-workflows from existing workflows
You can optionally create a sub-workflow directly from an existing parent workflow using the Execute Sub-workflow node. In the node, select the Database and From list options and select Create a sub-workflow in the list.
You can also extract selected nodes directly using Sub-workflow conversion in the context menu.
Optional: configure which workflows can call the sub-workflow:
Select the Options  menu > Settings. n8n opens the Workflow settings modal.
Change the This workflow can be called by setting. Refer to Workflow settings for more information on configuring your workflows.
Add the Execute Sub-workflow trigger node (if you are searching under trigger nodes, this is also titled When Executed by Another Workflow).
Set the Input data mode to choose how you will define the sub-workflow's input data:
Define using fields below: Choose this mode to define individual input names and data types that the calling workflow needs to provide. The Execute Sub-workflow node or Call n8n Workflow Tool node in the calling workflow will automatically pull in the fields defined here.
Define using JSON example: Choose this mode to provide an example JSON object that demonstrates the expected input items and their types.
Accept all data: Choose this mode to accept all data unconditionally. The sub-workflow won't define any required input items. This sub-workflow must handle any input inconsistencies or missing values.
Add other nodes as needed to build your sub-workflow functionality.
Save the sub-workflow.
Sub-workflow mustn't contain errors
If there are errors in the sub-workflow, the parent workflow can't trigger it.
Load data into sub-workflow before building
This requires the ability to load data from previous executions, which is available on n8n Cloud and registered Community plans.
If you want to load data into your sub-workflow to use while building it:
Create the sub-workflow and add the Execute Sub-workflow Trigger.
Set the node's Input data mode to Accept all data or define the input items using fields or JSON if they're already known.
In the sub-workflow settings, set Save successful production executions to Save.
Skip ahead to setting up the parent workflow, and run it.
Follow the steps to load data from previous executions.
Adjust the Input data mode to match the input sent by the parent workflow if necessary.
You can now pin example data in the trigger node, enabling you to work with real data while configuring the rest of the workflow.
Call the sub-workflow#
Open the workflow where you want to call the sub-workflow.
Add the Execute Sub-workflow node.
In the Execute Sub-workflow node, set the sub-workflow you want to call. You can choose to call the workflow by ID, load a workflow from a local file, add workflow JSON as a parameter in the node, or target a workflow by URL.
Find your workflow ID
Your sub-workflow's ID is the alphanumeric string at the end of its URL.
Fill in the required input items defined by the sub-workflow.
Save your workflow.
When your workflow executes, it will send data to the sub-workflow, and run it.
You can follow the execution flow from the parent workflow to the sub-workflow by opening the Execute Sub-workflow node and selecting the View sub-execution link. Likewise, the sub-workflow's execution contains a link back to the parent workflow's execution to navigate in the other direction.
How data passes between workflows#
As an example, imagine you have an Execute Sub-workflow node in Workflow A. The Execute Sub-workflow node calls another workflow called Workflow B:
The Execute Sub-workflow node passes the data to the Execute Sub-workflow Trigger node (titled "When executed by another node" in the canvas) of Workflow B.
The last node of Workflow B sends the data back to the Execute Sub-workflow node in Workflow A.
Execute Sub-workflow Trigger node#
Use this node to start a workflow in response to another workflow. It should be the first node in the workflow.
n8n allows you to call workflows from other workflows. This is useful if you want to:
Reuse a workflow: for example, you could have multiple workflows pulling and processing data from different sources, then have all those workflows call a single workflow that generates a report.
Break large workflows into smaller components.
Usage#
This node runs in response to a call from the Execute Sub-workflow or Call n8n Workflow Tool nodes.
Create the sub-workflow#
Create a new workflow.
Create sub-workflows from existing workflows
You can optionally create a sub-workflow directly from an existing parent workflow using the Execute Sub-workflow node. In the node, select the Database and From list options and select Create a sub-workflow in the list.
You can also extract selected nodes directly using Sub-workflow conversion in the context menu.
Optional: configure which workflows can call the sub-workflow:

The Execute Sub-workflow node passes the data to the Execute Sub-workflow Trigger node (titled "When executed by another node" in the canvas) of Workflow B.
The last node of Workflow B sends the data back to the Execute Sub-workflow node in Workflow A.
Execution Data#
Use this node to save metadata for workflow executions. You can then search by this data in the Executions list.
You can retrieve custom execution data during workflow execution using the Code node. Refer to Custom executions data for more information.
Feature availability
Available on Pro and Enterprise plans.
Operations#
Save Execution Data for Search
Data to Save#
Add a Saved Field for each key/value pair of metadata you'd like to save.
Limitations#
The Execution Data node has the following restrictions when storing execution metadata:
key: limited to 50 characters
value: limited to 512 characters
If either the key or value exceed the above limitations, n8n truncates to their maximum length and outputs a log entry.
Extract From File#
A common pattern in n8n workflows is to receive a file, either from and HTTP Request node (for files you are fetching from a website), a Webhook Node (for files which are sent to your workflow from elsewhere), or from a local source. Data obtained in this way is often in a binary format, for example a spreadsheet or PDF.
The Extract From File node extracts data from a binary format file and converts it to JSON, which can then be easily manipulated by the rest of your workflow. For converting JSON back into a binary file type, please see the Convert to File node.
Operations#
Use the Operations drop-down to select the format of the source file to extract data from.
Extract From CSV: The "Comma Separated Values" file type is commonly used for tabulated data.
Extract From HTML: Extract fields from standard web page HTML format files.
Extract From JSON: Extract JSON data from a binary file.
Extract From ICS: Extract fields from iCalendar format files.
Extract From ODS: Extract fields from ODS spreadsheet files.
Extract From PDF: Extract fields from Portable Document Format files.
Extract From RTF: Extract fields from Rich Text Format files.
Extract From Text File: Extract fields from a standard text file format.
Extract From XLS: Extract fields from a Microsoft Excel file (older format).
Extract From XLSX: Extract fields from a Microsoft Excel file.
Move File to Base64 String: Converts binary data to a text-friendly base64 format.
Example workflow#
In this example, a Webhook node is used to trigger the workflow. When a CSV file is sent to the webhook address, the file data is output and received by the Extract From File node.
Click to explore
View workflow file
Set to operate as 'Extract from CSV', the node then outputs the data as a series of JSON 'row' objects:
1
2
3
4
5
6
7
8
{
  "row": {
  "0": "apple",
  "1": "1",
  "2": "2",
  "3": "3"
  }
  ...



Receiving files with a webhook
Select the Webhook Node's Add Options button and select Raw body, then enable that setting to get the node to output the binary file that the subsequent node is expecting.
Node parameters#
Input Binary Field#
Enter the name of the field from the node input data that contains the binary file. The default is 'data'.
Destination Output Field#
Enter the name of the field in the node output that will contain the extracted data.
This parameter is only available for these operations:
Extract From JSON
Extract From ICS
Extract From Text File
Move File to Base64 String
Filter#
Filter items based on a condition. If the item meets the condition, the Filter node passes it on to the next node in the Filter node output. If the item doesn't meet the condition, the Filter node omits the item from its output.
Node parameters#
Create filter comparison Conditions to perform your filter.
Use the data type dropdown to select the data type and comparison operation type for your condition. For example, to filter for dates after a particular date, select Date & Time > is after.
The fields and values to enter into the condition change based on the data type and comparison you select. Refer to Available data type comparisons for a full list of all comparisons by data type.
Select Add condition to create more conditions.
Combining conditions#
You can choose to keep items:
When they meet all conditions: Create two or more conditions and select AND in the dropdown between them.
When they meet any of the conditions: Create two or more conditions and select OR in the dropdown between them.
You can't create a mix of AND and OR rules.
Node options#
Ignore Case: Whether to ignore letter case (turned on) or be case sensitive (turned off).
Less Strict Type Validation: Whether you want n8n to attempt to convert value types based on the operator you choose (turned on) or not (turned off). Turn this on when facing a "wrong type:" error in your node.

Control how to batch large numbers of input items:
Items per Batch: Enter the number of input items to include in each batch.
Batch Interval: Enter the time to wait between each batch of requests in milliseconds. Enter 0 for no batch interval.
Ignore SSL Issues#
By default, n8n only downloads the response if SSL certificate validation succeeds. If you'd like to download the response even if SSL certificate validation fails, turn this option on.
Lowercase Headers#
Choose whether to lowercase header names (turned on, default) or not (turned off).
Redirects#
Choose whether to follow redirects (turned on by default) or not (turned off). If turned on, enter the maximum number of redirects the request should follow in Max Redirects.
Response#
Use this option to set some details about the expected API response, including:
Include Response Headers and Status: By default, the node returns only the body. Turn this option on to return the full response (headers and response status code) as well as the body.
Never Error: By default, the node returns success only when the response returns with a 2xx code. Turn this option on to return success regardless of the code returned.
Response Format: Select the format in which the data gets returned. Choose from:
Autodetect (default): The node detects and formats the response based on the data returned.
File: Select this option to put the response into a file. Enter the field name where you want the file returned in Put Output in Field.
JSON: Select this option to format the response as JSON.
Text: Select this option to format the response as plain text. Enter the field name where you want the file returned in Put Output in Field.
Pagination#
Use this option to paginate results, useful for handling query results that are too big for the API to return in a single call.
Inspect the API data first
Some options for pagination require knowledge of the data returned by the API you're using. Before setting up pagination, either check the API documentation, or do an API call without pagination, to see the data it returns.
Understand pagination
Configure the pagination settings:
Pagination Mode:
Off: Turn off pagination.
Update a Parameter in Each Request: Use this when you need to dynamically set parameters for each request.
Response Contains Next URL: Use this when the API response includes the URL of the next page. Use an expression to set Next URL.
For example setups, refer to HTTP Request node cookbook | Pagination.
n8n provides built-in variables for working with HTTP node requests and responses when using pagination:
Variable
Description
$pageCount
The pagination count. Tracks how many pages the node has fetched.
$request
The request object sent by the HTTP node.
$response
The response object from the HTTP call. Includes $response.body, $response.headers, and $response.statusCode. The contents of body and headers depend on the data sent by the API.

API differences
Different APIs implement pagination in different ways. Check the API documentation for the API you're using for details. You need to find out things like:
Does the API provide the URL for the next page?
Are there API-specific limits on page size or page number?
The structure of the data that the API returns.
Proxy#
Use this option if you need to specify an HTTP proxy.
Enter the Proxy the request should use.
Timeout#
Use this option to set how long the node should wait for the server to send response headers (and start the response body). The node aborts requests that exceed this value for the initial response.
Enter the Timeout time to wait in milliseconds.
Tool-only options#
The following options are only available when attached to an AI agent as a tool.
Optimize Response#
Whether to optimize the tool response to reduce the amount of data passed to the LLM. Optimizing the response can reduce costs and can help the LLM ignore unimportant details, often leading to better results.
When optimizing responses, you select an expected response type, which determines other options you can configure. The supported response types are:
JSON#
When expecting a JSON response, you can configure which parts of the JSON data to use as a response with the following choices:
Field Containing Data: This field identifies a specific part of the JSON object that contains your relevant data. You can leave this blank to use the entire response.
Include Fields: This is how you choose which fields you want in your response object. There are three choices:
All: Include all fields in the response object.
Selected: Include only the fields specified below.
Fields: A comma-separated list of fields to include in the response. You can use dot notation to specify nested fields. You can drag fields from the Input panel to add them to the field list.
Exclude: Include all fields except the fields specified below.
Fields: A comma-separated list of fields to exclude from the response. You can use dot notation to specify nested fields. You can drag fields from the Input panel to add them to the field list.
HTML#
When expecting HTML, you can identify the part of an HTML document relevant to the LLM and optimize the response with the following options:
Selector (CSS): A specific element or element type to include in the response HTML. Uses the body element by default.
Return Only Content: Whether to strip HTML tags and attributes from the response, leaving only the actual content. This uses fewer tokens and may be easier for the model to understand.
Elements To Omit: A comma-separated list of CSS selectors to exclude when extracting content.
Truncate Response: Whether to limit the response size to save tokens.
Max Response Characters: The maximum number of characters to include in the HTML response. The default value is 1000.
Text#
When expecting a generic Text response, you can optimize the results with the following options:
Truncate Response: Whether to limit the response size to save tokens.
Max Response Characters: The maximum number of characters to include in the HTML response. The default value is 1000.
Import curl command#
curl is a command line tool and library for transferring data with URLs.
You can use curl to call REST APIs. If the API documentation of the service you want to use provides curl examples, you can copy them out of the documentation and into n8n to configure the HTTP Request node.
Import a curl command:
From the HTTP Request node's Parameters tab, select Import cURL. The Import cURL command modal opens.
Paste your curl command into the text box.
Select Import. n8n loads the request configuration into the node fields. This overwrites any existing configuration.
HTTP Request node common issues#
Here are some common errors and issues with the HTTP Request node and steps to resolve or troubleshoot them.
Bad request - please check your parameters#
This error displays when the node receives a 400 error indicating a bad request. This error most often occurs because:
You're using an invalid name or value in a Query Parameter.
You're passing array values in a Query Parameter but the array isn't formatted correctly. Try using the Array Format in Query Parameters option.
Review the API documentation for your service to format your query parameters.
The resource you are requesting could not be found#
This error displays when the endpoint URL you entered is invalid.
This may be due to a typo in the URL or a deprecated API. Refer to your service's API documentation to verify you have a valid endpoint.
JSON parameter need to be an valid JSON#
This error displays when you've passed a parameter as JSON and it's not formatted as valid JSON.
To resolve, review the JSON you've entered for these issues:
Test your JSON in a JSON checker or syntax parser to find errors like missing quotation marks, extra or missing commas, incorrectly formatted arrays, extra or missing square brackets or curly brackets, and so on.
If you've used an Expression in the node, be sure you've wrapped the entire JSON in double curly brackets, for example:
1
 2
 3
 4
 5
 6
 7
 8
 9
10
11
{{
    {
    "myjson":
    {
        "name1": "value1",
        "name2": "value2",
        "array1":
            ["value1","value2"]
    }
    }
}}



Forbidden - perhaps check your credentials#
This error displays when the node receives a 403 error indicating authentication failed.
To resolve, review the selected credentials and make sure you can authenticate with them. You may need to:
Update permissions or scopes so that your API key or account can perform the operation you've selected.
Format your generic credential in a different way.
Generate a new API key or token with the appropriate permissions or scopes.
429 - The service is receiving too many requests from you#
This error displays when the node receives a 429 error from the service that you're calling. This often means that you have hit the rate limits of that service. You can find out more on the Handling API rate limits page.
To resolve the error, you can use one of the built-in options of the HTTP request node:
Batching#
Use this option to send requests in batches and introduce a delay between them.
In the HTTP Request node, select Add Option > Batching.
Set Items per Batch to the number of input items to include in each request.
Set Batch Interval (ms) to introduce a delay between requests in milliseconds. For example, to send one request to an API per second, set Batch Interval (ms) to 1000.
Retry on Fail#
Use this option to retry the node after a failed attempt.
In the HTTP Request node, go to Settings and enable Retry on Fail.
Set Max Tries to the maximum number of times n8n should retry the node.
Set Wait Between Tries (ms) to the desired delay in milliseconds between retries. For example, to wait one second before retrying the request again, set Wait Between Tries (ms) to 1000.
If#
Use the If node to split a workflow conditionally based on comparison operations.
Add conditions#
Create comparison Conditions for your If node.
Use the data type dropdown to select the data type and comparison operation type for your condition. For example, to filter for dates after a particular date, select Date & Time > is after.
The fields and values to enter into the condition change based on the data type and comparison you select. Refer to Available data type comparisons for a full list of all comparisons by data type.
Select Add condition to create more conditions.
Combining conditions#
You can choose to keep data:
When it meets all conditions: Create two or more conditions and select AND in the dropdown between them.
When it meets any of the conditions: Create two or more conditions and select OR in the dropdown between them.

Branch execution with If and Merge nodes#
0.236.0 and below
n8n removed this execution behavior in version 1.0. This section applies to workflows using the v0 (legacy) workflow execution order. By default, this is all workflows built before version 1.0. You can change the execution order in your workflow settings.
If you add a Merge node to a workflow containing an If node, it can result in both output data streams of the If node executing.
One data stream triggers the Merge node, which then goes and executes the other data stream.
For example, in the screenshot below there's a workflow containing an Edit Fields node, If node, and Merge node. The standard If node behavior is to execute one data stream (in the screenshot, this is the true output). However, due to the Merge node, both data streams execute, despite the If node not sending any data down the false data stream.

Related resources#
Refer to Splitting with conditionals for more information on using conditionals to create complex logic in n8n.
If you need more than two conditional outputs, use the Switch node.

Items are only compared against previous executions
The current input items are only compared against the stored items from previous executions. This means that items repeated within the current input aren't removed in this mode of operation. If you need to remove duplicate items within the current input and across executions, connect two Remove Duplicate nodes together sequentially. Set the first to use the Remove Items Repated Within Current Input operation and the second to use the Remove Items Processed in Previous Executions operation.
Open the Code node and uncomment (remove the // from) the line for "Tom Hanks."
On the canvas, select Execute workflow again. Open the Remove Duplicates node again to examine the results.

RSS Feed Trigger node#
The RSS Feed Trigger node allows you to start an n8n workflow when a new RSS feed item has been published.
On this page, you'll find a list of operations the RSS Feed Trigger node supports, and links to more resources.
Node parameters#
Poll Times: Select a poll Mode to set how often to trigger the poll. Your Mode selection will add or remove relevant fields. Refer to the sections below to configure the parameters for each mode type.
Feed URL: Enter the URL of the RSS feed to poll.
Every Hour mode#
Enter the Minute of the hour to trigger the poll, from 0 to 59.
Every Day mode#
Enter the Hour of the day to trigger the poll in 24-hour format, from 0 to 23.
Enter the Minute of the hour to trigger the poll, from 0 to 59.
Every Week mode#
Enter the Hour of the day to trigger the poll in 24-hour format, from 0 to 23.
Enter the Minute of the hour to trigger the poll, from 0 to 59.
Select the Weekday to trigger the poll.
Every Month mode#
Enter the Hour of the day to trigger the poll in 24-hour format, from 0 to 23.
Enter the Minute of the hour to trigger the poll, from 0 to 59.
Enter the Day of the Month to trigger the poll, from 0 to 31.
Every X mode#
Enter the Value of measurement for how often to trigger the poll in either minutes or hours.
Select the Unit for the value. Supported units are Minutes and Hours.
Custom mode#
Enter a custom Cron Expression to trigger the poll. Use these values and ranges:
Seconds: 0 - 59
Minutes: 0 - 59
Hours: 0 - 23
Day of Month: 1 - 31
Months: 0 - 11 (Jan - Dec)
Day of Week: 0 - 6 (Sun - Sat)
To generate a Cron expression, you can use crontab guru. Paste the Cron expression that you generated using crontab guru in the Cron Expression field in n8n.
Examples#
If you want to trigger your workflow every day at 04:08:30, enter the following in the Cron Expression field.
1
30 8 4 * * *



If you want to trigger your workflow every day at 04:08, enter the following in the Cron Expression field.
1
8 4 * * *



Why there are six asterisks in the Cron expression#
The sixth asterisk in the Cron expression represents seconds. Setting this is optional. The node will execute even if you don't set the value for seconds.
*

Schedule Trigger node#
Use the Schedule Trigger node to run workflows at fixed intervals and times. This works in a similar way to the Cron software utility in Unix-like systems.
You must activate the workflow
If a workflow uses the Schedule node as a trigger, make sure that you save and activate the workflow.
Timezone settings
The node relies on the timezone setting. n8n uses either:
The workflow timezone, if set. Refer to Workflow settings for more information.
The n8n instance timezone, if the workflow timezone isn't set. The default is America/New York for self-hosted instances. n8n Cloud tries to detect the instance owner's timezone when they sign up, falling back to GMT as the default. Self-hosted users can change the instance setting using Environment variables. Cloud admins can change the instance timezone in the Admin dashboard.
Node parameters#
Add Trigger Rules to determine when the trigger should run.
Use the Trigger Interval to select the time interval unit of measure to schedule the trigger for. All other parameters depend on the interval you select. Choose from:
Seconds trigger interval
Minutes trigger interval
Hours trigger interval
Days trigger interval
Weeks trigger interval
Months trigger interval
Custom (Cron) interval
You can add multiple Trigger Rules to run the node on different schedules.
Refer to the sections below for more detail on configuring each Trigger Interval. Refer to Templates and examples for further examples.
Seconds trigger interval#
Seconds Between Triggers: Enter the number of seconds between each workflow trigger. For example, if you enter 30 here, the trigger will run every 30 seconds.
Minutes trigger interval#
Minutes Between Triggers: Enter the number of minutes between each workflow trigger. For example, if you enter 5 here, the trigger will run every 5 minutes.
Hours trigger interval#
Hours Between Triggers: Enter the number of hours between each workflow trigger.
Trigger at Minute: Enter the minute past the hour to trigger the node when it runs, from 0 to 59.
For example, if you enter 6 Hours Between Triggers and 30 Trigger at Minute, the node will run every six hours at 30 minutes past the hour.
Days trigger interval#
Days Between Triggers: Enter the number of days between each workflow trigger.
Trigger at Hour: Select the hour of the day to trigger the node.
Trigger at Minute: Enter the minute past the hour to trigger the node when it runs, from 0 to 59.
For example, if you enter 2 Days Between Triggers, 9am for Trigger at Hour, and 15 Trigger at Minute, the node will run every two days at 9:15am.
Weeks trigger interval#
Weeks Between Triggers: Enter the number of weeks between each workflow trigger.
Trigger on Weekdays: Select the day(s) of the week you want to trigger the node.
Trigger at Hour: Select the hour of the day to trigger the node.
Trigger at Minute: Enter the minute past the hour to trigger the node when it runs, from 0 to 59.
For example, if you enter 2 Weeks Between Triggers, Monday for Trigger on Weekdays, 3pm for Trigger at Hour, and 30 Trigger at Minute, the node will run every two weeks on Monday at 3:30 PM.
Months trigger interval#
Months Between Triggers: Enter the number of months between each workflow trigger.
Trigger at Day of Month: Enter the day of the month the day should trigger at, from 1 to 31. If a month doesn't have this day, the node won't trigger. For example, if you enter 30 here, the node won't trigger in February.
Trigger at Hour: Select the hour of the day to trigger the node.
Trigger at Minute: Enter the minute past the hour to trigger the node when it runs, from 0 to 59.
For example, if you enter 3 Months Between Triggers, 28 Trigger at Day of Month, 9am for Trigger at Hour, and 0 Trigger at Minute, the node will run each quarter on the 28th day of the month at 9:00 AM.
Custom (Cron) interval#
Enter a custom cron Expression to set the schedule for the trigger.
To generate a Cron expression, you can use crontab guru. Paste the Cron expression that you generated using crontab guru in the Expression field in n8n.

Using variables in the Cron expression
While variables can be used in the scheduled trigger, their values only get evaluated when the workflow is activated. If you alter a variable's value in the settings after a workflow is activated, the changes won't alter the cron schedule. To re-evaluate the variable, set the workflow to Inactive and then back to Active again
Why there are six asterisks in the Cron expression#
The sixth asterisk in the Cron expression represents seconds. Setting this is optional. The node will execute even if you don't set the value for seconds.

Schedule Trigger node common issues#
Here are some common errors and issues with the Schedule Trigger node and steps to resolve or troubleshoot them.
Invalid cron expression#
This error occurs when you set Trigger Interval to Custom (Cron) and n8n doesn't understand your cron expression. This may mean that there is a mistake in your cron expression or that you're using an incompatible syntax.
To debug, check that the following:
That your cron expression follows the syntax used in the cron examples
That your cron expression (after removing the seconds column) validates on crontab guru
Scheduled workflows run at the wrong time#
If the Schedule Trigger node runs at the wrong time, it may mean that you need to adjust the time zone n8n uses.
Adjust the timezone globally#
If you're using n8n Cloud, follow the instructions on the set the Cloud instance timezone page to ensure that n8n executes in sync with your local time.
If you're self hosting, set your global timezone using the GENERIC_TIMEZONE environment variable.
Adjust the timezone for an individual workflow#
To set the timezone for an individual workflow:
Open the workflow on the canvas.
Select the  Three dots icon in the upper-right corner.
Select Settings.
Change the Timezone setting.
Select Save.
Variables not working as expected#
While variables can be used in the scheduled trigger, their values only get evaluated when the workflow is activated. After activating the worfklow, you can alter a variable's value in the settings but it won't change how often the workflow runs. To work around this, you must stop and then re-activate the workflow to apply the updated variable value.
Changing the trigger interval#
You can update the scheduled trigger interval at any time but it only gets updated when the workflow is activated. If you change the trigger interval after the workflow is active, the changes won't take effect until you stop and then re-activate the workflow.
Also, the schedule begins from the time when you activate the workflow. For example, if you had originally set a schedule of every 1 hour and it should execute at 12:00, if you changed it to a 2 hour schedule and re-activated the workflow at 11:30, the next execution will be at 13:30, 2 hours from when you activated it.

Refer to Time-based operations for more detail on the timezone used.
On Webhook Call#
This parameter enables your workflows to resume when the Wait node receives an HTTP call.
The webhook URL that resumes the execution when called is generated at runtime. The Wait node provides the $execution.resumeUrl variable so that you can reference and send the yet-to-be-generated URL wherever needed, for example to a third-party service or in an email.
When the workflow executes, the Wait node generates the resume URL and the webhook(s) in your workflow using the $execution.resumeUrl. This generated URL is unique to each execution, so your workflow can contain multiple Wait nodes and as the webhook URL is called it will resume each Wait node sequentially.
For this Resume style, set more parameters listed below.
Authentication#
Select if and how incoming resume-webhook-requests to $execution.resumeUrl should be authenticated. Options include:
Basic Auth: Use basic authentication. Select or enter a new Credential for Basic Auth to use.

Response Headers: Send more headers in the webhook response. Refer to MDN Web Docs | Response header to learn more about response headers.
Webhook Suffix: Enter a suffix to append to the resume URL. This is useful for creating unique webhook URLs for each Wait node when a workflow contains multiple Wait nodes. Note that the generated $resumeWebhookUrl won't automatically include this suffix, you must manually append it to the webhook URL before exposing it.
On Webhook Call limitations#
There are some limitations to keep in mind when using On Webhook Call:
Partial executions of your workflow changes the $resumeWebhookUrl, so be sure that the node sending this URL to your desired third-party runs in the same execution as the Wait node.
On Form Submitted#
Wait for a form submission before continuing. Set up these parameters:

On Form Response options#
Form Response: Choose how and what you want the form to Respond With from these options:
Form Submitted Text: The form displays whatever text is entered in Text to Show after a user fills out the form. Use this option if you want to display a confirmation message.
Redirect URL: The form will redirect the user to the URL to Redirect to after they fill out the form. This must be a valid URL.
Webhook Suffix: Enter a suffix to append to the resume URL. This is useful for creating unique webhook URLs for each Wait node when a workflow contains multiple Wait nodes. Note that the generated $resumeWebhookUrl won't automatically include this suffix, you must manually append it to the webhook URL before exposing it.

Time-based operations#
For the time-based resume operations, note that:
For wait times less than 65 seconds, the workflow doesn't offload execution data to the database. Instead, the process continues to run and the execution resumes after the specified interval passes.
The n8n server time is always used regardless of the timezone setting. Workflow timezone settings, and any changes made to them, don't affect the Wait node interval or specified time.
Webhook node#
Use the Webhook node to create webhooks, which can receive data from apps and services when an event occurs. It's a trigger node, which means it can start an n8n workflow. This allows services to connect to n8n and run a workflow.
You can use the Webhook node as a trigger for a workflow when you want to receive data and run a workflow based on the data. The Webhook node also supports returning the data generated at the end of a workflow. This makes it useful for building a workflow to process data and return the results, like an API endpoint.
The webhook allows you to trigger workflows from services that don't have a dedicated app trigger node.
Workflow development process#
n8n provides different Webhook URLs for testing and production. The testing URL includes an option to Listen for test event. Refer to Workflow development for more information on building, testing, and shifting your Webhook node to production.
Node parameters#
Use these parameters to configure your node.
Webhook URLs#
The Webhook node has two Webhook URLs: test and production. n8n displays the URLs at the top of the node panel.
Select Test URL or Production URL to toggle which URL n8n displays.
Sample Webhook URLs in the Webhook node's Parameters tab
Test: n8n registers a test webhook when you select Listen for Test Event or Execute workflow, if the workflow isn't active. When you call the webhook URL, n8n displays the data in the workflow.
Production: n8n registers a production webhook when you activate the workflow. When using the production URL, n8n doesn't display the data in the workflow. You can still view workflow data for a production execution: select the Executions tab in the workflow, then select the workflow execution you want to view.
HTTP Method#
The Webhook node supports standard HTTP Request Methods:
DELETE
GET
HEAD
PATCH
POST
PUT
Webhook max payload
The webhook maximum payload size is 16MB. If you're self-hosting n8n, you can change this using the endpoint environment variable N8N_PAYLOAD_SIZE_MAX.
Path#
By default, this field contains a randomly generated webhook URL path, to avoid conflicts with other webhook nodes.
You can manually specify a URL path, including adding route parameters. For example, you may need to do this if you use n8n to prototype an API and want consistent endpoint URLs.
The Path field can take the following formats:
/:variable
/path/:variable
/:variable/path
/:variable1/path/:variable2
/:variable1/:variable2
Supported authentication methods#
You can require authentication for any service calling your webhook URL. Choose from these authentication methods:
Basic auth
Header auth
JWT auth
None
Refer to Webhook credentials for more information on setting up each credential type.
Respond#
Immediately: The Webhook node returns the response code and the message Workflow got started.
When Last Node Finishes: The Webhook node returns the response code and the data output from the last node executed in the workflow.
Using 'Respond to Webhook' Node: The Webhook node responds as defined in the Respond to Webhook node.
Response Code#
Customize the HTTP response code that the Webhook node returns upon successful execution. Select from common response codes or create a custom code.
Response Data#
Choose what data to include in the response body:
All Entries: The Webhook returns all the entries of the last node in an array.
First Entry JSON: The Webhook returns the JSON data of the first entry of the last node in a JSON object.
First Entry Binary: The Webhook returns the binary data of the first entry of the last node in a binary file.
No Response Body: The Webhook returns without a body.
Applies only to Respond > When Last Node Finishes.

Workflow development#
The Webhook node works a bit differently from other core nodes. n8n recommends following these processes for building, testing, and using your Webhook node in production.
n8n generates two Webhook URLs for each Webhook node: a Test URL and a Production URL.
Build and test workflows#
While building or testing a workflow, use the Test webhook URL.
Using a test webhook ensures that you can view the incoming data in the editor UI, which is useful for debugging. Select Listen for test event to register the webhook before sending the data to the test webhook. The test webhook stays active for 120 seconds.
When using the Webhook node on localhost on a self-hosted n8n instance, run n8n in tunnel mode:
npm with tunnel
Docker with tunnel
Production workflows#
When your workflow is ready, switch to using the Production webhook URL. You can then activate your workflow, and n8n runs it automatically when an external service calls the webhook URL.
When working with a Production webhook, ensure that you have saved and activated the workflow. Data flowing through the webhook isn't visible in the editor UI with the production webhook.
Refer to Create a workflow for more information on activating workflows.
Common issues and questions#
Here are some common issues and questions for the Webhook node and suggested solutions.
Listen for multiple HTTP methods#
By default, the Webhook node accepts calls that use a single method. For example, it can accept GET or POST requests, but not both. If you want to accept calls using multiple methods:
Open the node Settings.
Turn on Allow Multiple HTTP Methods.
Return to Parameters. By default, the node now accepts GET and POST calls. You can add other methods in the HTTP Methods field.
The Webhook node has an output for each method, so you can perform different actions depending on the method.
Use the HTTP Request node to trigger the Webhook node#
The HTTP Request node makes HTTP requests to the URL you specify.
Create a new workflow.
Add the HTTP Request node to the workflow.
Select a method from the Request Method dropdown list. For example, if you select GET as the HTTP method in your Webhook node, select GET as the request method in the HTTP Request node.
Copy the URL from the Webhook node, and paste it in the URL field in the HTTP Request node.
If using the test URL for the webhook node: execute the workflow with the Webhook node.
Execute the HTTP Request node.
Use curl to trigger the Webhook node#
You can use curl to make HTTP requests that trigger the Webhook node.
Note
In the examples, replace <https://your-n8n.url/webhook/path> with your webhook URL.
The examples make GET requests. You can use whichever HTTP method you set in HTTP Method.
Make an HTTP request without any parameters:
1
curl --request GET <https://your-n8n.url/webhook/path>



Make an HTTP request with a body parameter:
1
curl --request GET <https://your-n8n.url/webhook/path> --data 'key=value'



Make an HTTP request with header parameter:
1
curl --request GET <https://your-n8n.url/webhook/path> --header 'key=value'



Make an HTTP request to send a file:
1
curl --request GET <https://your-n8n.url/webhook/path> --from 'key=@/path/to/file'



Replace /path/to/file with the path of the file you want to send.
Send a response of type string#
By default, the response format is JSON or an array. To send a response of type string:
Select Response Mode > When Last Node Finishes.
Select Response Data > First Entry JSON.
Select Add Option > Property Name.
Enter the name of the property that contains the response. This defaults to data.
Connect an Edit Fields node to the Webhook node.
In the Edit Fields node, select Add Value > String.
Enter the name of the property in the Name field. The name should match the property name from step 4.
Enter the string value in the Value field.
Toggle Keep Only Set to on (green).
When you call the Webhook, it sends the string response from the Edit Fields node.
Test URL versus Production URL#
n8n generates two Webhook URLs for each Webhook node: a Test URL and a Production URL.
While building or testing a workflow, use the Test URL. Once you're ready to use your Webhook URL in production, use the Production URL.
URL type

Listening duration
Data shown in editor UI?
Test URL
Select Listen for test event and trigger a test event from the source.

Production URL
Activate the workflow
Until workflow deactivated


Refer to Workflow development for more information.
IP addresses in whitelist are failing to connect#
If you're unable to connect from IP addresses in your IP whitelist, check if you are running n8n behind a reverse proxy.
If so, set the N8N_PROXY_HOPS environment variable to the number of reverse-proxies n8n is running behind.
Only one webhook per path and method#
n8n only permits registering one webhook for each path and HTTP method combination (for example, a GET request for /my-request). This avoids ambiguity over which webhook should receive requests.
If you receive a message that the path and method you chose are already in use, you can either:
Deactivate the workflow with the conflicting webhook.
Change the webhook path and/or method for one of the conflicting webhooks.
Workflow Trigger node#
The Workflow Trigger node gets triggered when a workflow is updated or activated.
Deprecated
n8n has deprecated the Workflow Trigger node and moved its functionality to the n8n Trigger node.
Keep in mind
If you want to use the Workflow Trigger node for a workflow, add the node to the workflow. You don't have to create a separate workflow.
The Workflow Trigger node gets triggered for the workflow that it gets added to. You can use the Workflow Trigger node to trigger a workflow to notify the state of the workflow.
Node parameters#
The node includes a single parameter to identify the Events that should trigger it. Choose from these events:
Active Workflow Updated: If you select this event, the node triggers when this workflow is updated.
Workflow Activated: If you select this event, the node triggers when this workflow is activated.
You can select one or both of these events.
XML#
Use the XML node to convert data from and to XML.
Binary files
If your XML is within a binary file, use the Extract from File node to convert it to text first.
Node parameters#
Mode: The format the data should be converted from and to.
JSON to XML: Converts data from JSON to XML.
XML to JSON: Converts data from XML to JSON.
Property Name: Enter the name of the property which contains the data to convert.
Node options#
These options are available regardless of the Mode you select:
Attribute Key: Enter the prefix used to access the attributes. Default is $.
Character Key: Enter the prefix used to access the character content. Default is _.
All other options depend on the selected Mode.
JSON to XML options#
These options only appear if you select JSON to XML as the Mode:
Allow Surrogate Chars: Set whether to allow using characters from the Unicode surrogate blocks (turned on) or not (turned off).
Cdata: Set whether to wrap text nodes in <![CDATA[ ... ]]> instead of escaping when it's required (turned on) or not (turned off).
Turning this option on doesn't add <![CDATA[ ... ]]> if it's not required.
Headless: Set whether to omit the XML header (turned on) or include it (turned off).
Root Name: Enter the root element name to use.
XML to JSON options#
These options only appear if you select XML to JSON as the Mode:
Explicit Array: Set whether to put child nodes in an array (turned on) or create an array only if there's more than one child node (turned off).
Explicit Root: Set whether to get the root node in the resulting object (turned on) or not (turned off).
Ignore Attributes: Set whether to ignore all XML attributes and only create text nodes (turned on) or not (turned off).
Merge Attributes: Set whether to merge attributes and child elements as properties of the parent (turned on) or key attributes off a child attribute object (turned off). This option is ignored if Ignore Attribute is turned on.
Normalize: Set whether to trim whitespaces inside the text nodes (turned on) or not to trim them (turned off).
Normalize Tags: Set whether to normalize all tag names to lowercase (turned on) or keep tag names as-is (turned off).
Trim: Set whether to trim the whitespace at the beginning and end of text nodes (turned on) or to leave the whitespace as-is (turned off).

Integrations#
n8n calls integrations nodes.
Nodes are the building blocks of workflows in n8n. They're an entry point for retrieving data, a function to process data, or an exit for sending data. The data process includes filtering, recomposing, and changing data. There can be one or several nodes for your API, service or app. You can connect multiple nodes, which allows you to create complex workflows.
Built-in nodes#
n8n includes a collection of built-in integrations. Refer to Built-in nodes for documentation on all n8n's built-in nodes.
Community nodes#
As well as using the built-in nodes, you can also install community-built nodes. Refer to Community nodes for more information.
Credential-only nodes and custom operations#
One of the most complex parts of setting up API calls is managing authentication. n8n provides credentials support for operations and services beyond those supported by built-in nodes.
Custom operations for existing nodes: n8n supplies hundreds of nodes to create workflows that link multiple products. However, some nodes don't include all the possible operations supported by a product's API. You can work around this by making a custom API call using the HTTP Request node.
Credential-only nodes: n8n includes credential-only nodes. These are integrations where n8n supports setting up credentials for use in the HTTP Request node, but doesn't provide a standalone node. You can find a credential-only node in the nodes panel, as you would for any other integration.
Refer to Custom operations for more information.
Generic integrations#
If you need to connect to a service where n8n doesn't have a node, or a credential-only node, you can still use the HTTP Request node. Refer to the node page for details on how to set up authentication and create your API call.
Where to go next#
If you want to create your own node, head over to the Creating Nodes section.
Check out Community nodes to learn about installing and managing community-built nodes.
If you'd like to learn more about the different nodes in n8n, their functionalities and example usage, check out n8n's node libraries: Core nodes, Actions, and Triggers.
If you'd like to learn how to add the credentials for the different nodes, head over to the Credentials section.
Built-in integrations#
This section contains the node library: reference documentation for every built-in node in n8n, and their credentials.
Node operations: Triggers and Actions#
When you add a node to a workflow, n8n displays a list of available operations. An operation is something a node does, such as getting or sending data.
There are two types of operation:
Triggers start a workflow in response to specific events or conditions in your services. When you select a Trigger, n8n adds a trigger node to your workflow, with the Trigger operation you chose pre-selected. When you search for a node in n8n, Trigger operations have a bolt icon .
Actions are operations that represent specific tasks within a workflow, which you can use to manipulate data, perform operations on external systems, and trigger events in other systems as part of your workflows. When you select an Action, n8n adds a node to your workflow, with the Action operation you chose pre-selected.
Core nodes#
Core nodes can be actions or triggers. Whereas most nodes connect to a specific external service, core nodes provide functionality such as logic, scheduling, or generic API calls.
Cluster nodes#
Cluster nodes are node groups that work together to provide functionality in an n8n workflow. Instead of using a single node, you use a root node and one or more sub-nodes that extend the functionality of the node.

Credentials#
External services need a way to identify and authenticate users. This data can range from an API key over an email/password combination to a long multi-line private key. You can save these in n8n as credentials.
Nodes in n8n can then request that credential information. As another layer of security, only node types with specific access rights can access the credentials.
To make sure that the data is secure, it gets saved to the database encrypted. n8n uses a random personal encryption key, which it automatically generates on the first run of n8n and then saved under ~/.n8n/config.
To learn more about creating, managing, and sharing credentials, refer to Manage credentials.
Community nodes#
n8n supports custom nodes built by the community. Refer to Community nodes for guidance on installing and using these nodes.
For help building your own custom nodes, and publish them to npm, refer to Creating nodes for more information.
Core nodes library#
This section provides information about n8n's core nodes.
Activation Trigger node#
The Activation Trigger node gets triggered when an event gets fired by n8n or a workflow.
Warning
n8n has deprecated the Activation Trigger node and replaced it with two new nodes: the n8n Trigger node and the Workflow Trigger node. For more details, check out the entry in the breaking changes page.
Keep in mind
If you want to use the Activation Trigger node for a workflow, add the node to the workflow. You don't have to create a separate workflow.
The Activation Trigger node gets triggered for the workflow that it gets added to. You can use the Activation Trigger node to trigger a workflow to notify the state of the workflow.
Node parameters#
Events
Activation: Run when the workflow gets activated
Start: Run when n8n starts or restarts
Update: Run when the workflow gets saved while it's active
Aggregate#
Use the Aggregate node to take separate items, or portions of them, and group them together into individual items.
Node parameters#
To begin using the node, select the Aggregate you'd like to use:
Individual Fields: Aggregate individual fields separately.
All Item Data: Aggregate all item data into a single list.
Individual Fields#
Input Field Name: Enter the name of the field in the input data to aggregate together.
Rename Field: This toggle controls whether to give the field a different name in the aggregated output data. Turn this on to add a different field name. If you're aggregating multiple fields, you must provide new output field names. You can't leave multiple fields undefined.
Output Field Name: This field is displayed when you turn on Rename Field. Enter the field name for the aggregated output data.
Refer to Node options for more configuration options.
All Item Data#
Put Output in Field: Enter the name of the field to output the data in.
Include: Select which fields to include in the output. Choose from:
All fields: The output includes data from all fields with no further parameters.
Specified Fields: If you select this option, enter a comma-separated list of fields the output should include data from in the Fields To Include parameter. The output will include only the fields in this list.
All Fields Except: If you select this option, enter a comma-separated list of fields the output should exclude data from in the Fields To Exclude parameter. The output will include all fields not in this list.
Refer to Node options for more configuration options.
Node options#
You can further configure this node using these Options:
Disable Dot Notation: The node displays this toggle when you select the Individual Fields Aggregate. It controls whether to disallow referencing child fields using parent.child in the field name (turned on), or allow it (turned off, default).
Merge Lists: The node displays this toggle when you select the Individual Fields Aggregate. Turn it on if the field to aggregate is a list and you want to output a single flat list rather than a list of lists.
Include Binaries: The node displays this toggle for both Aggregate types. Turn it on if you want to include binary data from the input in the new output.
Keep Missing And Null Values: The node displays this toggle when you select the Individual Fields Aggregate. Turn it on to add a null (empty) entry in the output list when there is a null or missing value in the input. If turned off, the output ignores null or empty values.
AI Transform#
Use the AI Transform node to generate code snippets based on your prompt. The AI is context-aware, understanding the workflow’s nodes and their data types.
Feature availability
Available only on Cloud plans.
Node parameters#
Instructions#
Enter your prompt for the AI and click the Generate code button to automatically populate the Transformation Code. For example, you can specify how you want to process or categorize your data. Refer to Writing good prompts for more information.
The prompt should be in plain English and under 500 characters.
Transformation Code#
The code snippet generated by the node is read-only. To edit this code, adjust your prompt in Instructions or copy and paste it into a Code node.
Code node#
Use the Code node to write custom JavaScript or Python and run it as a step in your workflow.
Coding in n8n
This page gives usage information about the Code node. For more guidance on coding in n8n, refer to the Code section. It includes:
Reference documentation on Built-in methods and variables
Guidance on Handling dates and Querying JSON
A growing collection of examples in the Cookbook
Examples and templates
For usage examples and templates to help you get started, refer to n8n's Code integrations page.
Function and Function Item nodes
The Code node replaces the Function and Function Item nodes from version 0.198.0. If you're using an older version of n8n, you can still view the Function node documentation and Function Item node documentation.
Usage#
How to use the Code node.
Choose a mode#
There are two modes:
Run Once for All Items: this is the default. When your workflow runs, the code in the code node executes once, regardless of how many input items there are.
Run Once for Each Item: choose this if you want your code to run for every input item.
JavaScript#
The Code node supports Node.js.
Supported JavaScript features#
The Code node supports:
Promises. Instead of returning the items directly, you can return a promise which resolves accordingly.
Writing to your browser console using console.log. This is useful for debugging and troubleshooting your workflows.
External libraries#
If you self-host n8n, you can import and use built-in and external npm modules in the Code node. To learn how to enable external modules, refer to the Enable modules in Code node guide.
If you use n8n Cloud, you can't import external npm modules. n8n makes two modules available for you:
crypto Node.js module
moment npm package
Built-in methods and variables#
n8n provides built-in methods and variables for working with data and accessing n8n data. Refer to Built-in methods and variables for more information.
The syntax to use the built-in methods and variables is $variableName or $methodName(). Type $ in the Code node or expressions editor to see a list of suggested methods and variables.
Keyboard shortcuts#
The Code node editing environment supports time-saving and useful keyboard shortcuts for a range of operations from autocompletion to code-folding and using multiple-cursors. A full list can be found in the list of keyboard shortcuts.
Python#
n8n added Python support in version 1.0. It doesn't include a Python executable. Instead, n8n provides Python support using Pyodide, which is a port of CPython to WebAssembly. This limits the available Python packages to the Packages included with Pyodide. n8n downloads the package automatically the first time you use it.
Slower than JavaScript
The Code node takes longer to process Python than JavaScript. This is due to the extra compilation steps.
Built-in methods and variables#
n8n provides built-in methods and variables for working with data and accessing n8n data. Refer to Built-in methods and variables for more information.
The syntax to use the built-in methods and variables is _variableName or _methodName(). Type _ in the Code node to see a list of suggested methods and variables.
Keyboard shortcuts#
The Code node editing environment supports time-saving and useful keyboard shortcuts for a range of operations from autocompletion to code-folding and using multiple-cursors. A full list can be found in the list of keyboard shortcuts.
File system and HTTP requests#
You can't access the file system or make HTTP requests. Use the following nodes instead:
Read/Write File From Disk
HTTP Request
Coding in n8n#
There are two places where you can use code in n8n: the Code node and the expressions editor. When using either area, there are some key concepts you need to know, as well as some built-in methods and variables to help with common tasks.
Key concepts#
When working with the Code node, you need to understand the following concepts:
Data structure: understand the data you receive in the Code node, and requirements for outputting data from the node.
Item linking: learn how data items work, and how to link to items from previous nodes. You need to handle item linking in your code when the number of input and output items doesn't match.
Built-in methods and variables#
n8n includes built-in methods and variables. These provide support for:
Accessing specific item data
Accessing data about workflows, executions, and your n8n environment
Convenience variables to help with data and time
Refer to Built-in methods and variables for more information.
Use AI in the Code node#
Feature availability
AI assistance in the Code node is available to Cloud users. It isn't available in self-hosted n8n.
AI generated code overwrites your code
If you've already written some code on the Code tab, the AI generated code will replace it. n8n recommends using AI as a starting point to create your initial code, then editing it as needed.
To use ChatGPT to generate code in the Code node:
In the Code node, set Language to JavaScript.
Select the Ask AI tab.
Write your query.
Select Generate Code. n8n sends your query to ChatGPT, then displays the result in the Code tab.
Keyboard shortcuts when using the Code editor#
The Code node editing environment supports a range of keyboard shortcuts to speed up and enhance your experience. Select the appropriate tab to see the relevant shortcuts for your operating system.

Code node common issues#
Here are some common errors and issues with the Code node and steps to resolve or troubleshoot them.
Code doesn't return items properly#
This error occurs when the code in your Code node doesn't return data in the expected format.
In n8n, all data passed between nodes is an array of objects. Each of these objects wraps another object with the json key:
1
2
3
4
5
6
7
[
  {
    "json": {
	  // your data goes here
	}
  }
]



To troubleshoot this error, check the following:
Read the data structure to understand the data you receive in the Code node and the requirements for outputting data from the node.
Understand how data items work and how to connect data items from previous nodes with item linking.
A 'json' property isn't an object#
This error occurs when the Code node returns data where the json key isn't pointing to an object.
This may happen if you set json to a different data structure, like an array:
1
2
3
4
5
6
7
[
  {
    "json": [
	  // Setting `json` to an array like this will produce an error
	]
  }
]



To resolve this, ensure that the json key references an object in your return data:
1
2
3
4
5
6
7
[
  {
    "json": {
	  // Setting `json` to an object as expected
	}
  }
]



Code doesn't return an object#
This error may occur when your Code node doesn't return anything or if it returns an unexpected result.
To resolve this, ensure that your Code node returns the expected data structure:
1
2
3
4
5
6
7
[
  {
    "json": {
	  // your data goes here
	}
  }
]



This error may also occur if the code you provided returns 'undefined' instead of the expected result. In that case, ensure that the data you are referencing in your Code node exists in each execution and that it has the structure your code expects.
'import' and 'export' may only appear at the top level#
This error occurs if you try to use import or export in the Code node. These aren't supported by n8n's JavaScript sandbox. Instead, use the require function to load modules.
To resolve this issue, try changing your import statements to use require:
1
2
3
4
// Original code:
// import express from "express";
// New code:
const express = require("express");



Cannot find module '<module>'#
This error occurs if you try to use require in the Code node and n8n can't find the module.
Only for self-hosted
n8n doesn't support importing modules in the Cloud version.
If you're self-hosting n8n, follow these steps:
Install the module into your n8n environment.
If you are running n8n with npm, install the module in the same environment as n8n.
If you are running n8n with Docker, you need to extend the official n8n image with a custom image that includes your module.
Set the NODE_FUNCTION_ALLOW_BUILTIN and NODE_FUNCTION_ALLOW_EXTERNAL environment variables to allow importing modules.
Using global variables#
Sometimes you may wish to set and retrieve simple global data related to a workflow across and within executions. For example, you may wish to include the date of the previous report when compiling a report with a list of project updates.
To set, update, and retrieve data directly to a workflow, use the static data functions within your code. You can manage data either globally or tied to specific nodes.
Compare Datasets#
The Compare Datasets node helps you compare data from two input streams.
Node parameters#
Decide which fields to compare. In Input A Field, enter the name of the field you want to use from input stream A. In Input B Field, enter the name of the field you want to use from input stream B.
Optional: You can compare by multiple fields. Select Add Fields to Match to set up more comparisons.
Choose how to handle differences between the datasets. In When There Are Differences, select one of the following:
Use Input A Version to treat input stream A as the source of truth.
Use Input B Version to treat input stream B as the source of truth.
Use a Mix of Versions to use different inputs for different fields.
Use Prefer to select either Input A Version or Input B Version as the main source of truth.
Enter input fields that are exceptions to For Everything Except to pull from the other input source. To add multiple input fields, enter a comma-separated list.
Include Both Versions to include both input streams in the output, which may make the structure more complex.
Decide whether to use Fuzzy Compare. When turned on, the comparison will tolerate small type differences when comparing fields. For example, the number 3 and the string 3 are treated as the same with Fuzzy Compare turned on, but wouldn't be treated the same with it turned off.
Understand item comparison#
Item comparison is a two stage process:
n8n checks if the values of the fields you selected to compare match across both inputs.
If the fields to compare match, n8n then compares all fields within the items, to determine if the items are the same or different.
Node options#
Use the node Options to refine your comparison or tweak comparison behavior.
Fields to Skip Comparing#
Enter field names that you want to ignore in the comparison.
For example, if you compare the two datasets below using person.language as the Fields to Match, n8n returns them as different. If you add person.name to Fields to Skip Comparing, n8n returns them as matching.

Chat Trigger node#
Use the Chat Trigger node when building AI workflows for chatbots and other chat interfaces. You can configure how users access the chat, using one of n8n's provided interfaces, or your own. You can add authentication.
You must connect either an agent or chain root node.
Workflow execution usage
Every message to the Chat Trigger executes your workflow. This means that one conversation where a user sends 10 messages uses 10 executions from your execution allowance. Check your payment plan for details of your allowance.
Manual Chat trigger
This node replaces the Manual Chat Trigger node from version 1.24.0.
Node parameters#
Make Chat Publicly Available#
Set whether the chat should be publicly available (turned on) or only available through the manual chat interface (turned off).
Leave this turned off while you're building the workflow. Turn it on when you're ready to activate the workflow and allow users to access the chat.
Mode#
Choose how users access the chat. Select from:
Hosted Chat: Use n8n's hosted chat interface. Recommended for most users because you can configure the interface using the node options and don't have to do any other setup.
Embedded Chat: This option requires you to create your own chat interface. You can use n8n's chat widget or build your own. Your chat interface must call the webhook URL shown in Chat URL in the node.
Authentication#
Choose whether and how to restrict access to the chat. Select from:
None: The chat doesn't use authentication. Anyone can use the chat.
Basic Auth: The chat uses basic authentication.
Select or create a Credential for Basic Auth with a username and password. All users must use the same username and password.
n8n User Auth: Only users logged in to an n8n account can use the chat.
Initial Message(s)#
This parameter's only available if you're using Hosted Chat. Use it to configure the message the n8n chat interface displays when the user arrives on the page.
Node options#
Available options depend on the chat mode.
Hosted chat options#
Allowed Origin (CORS)#
Set the origins that can access the chat URL. Enter a comma-separated list of URLs allowed for cross-origin non-preflight requests.
Use * (default) to allow all origins.
Input Placeholder, Title, and Subtitle#
Enter the text for these elements in the chat interface.
View screenshot

Load Previous Session#
Select whether to load chat messages from a previous chat session.
If you select any option other than Off, you must connect the Chat trigger and the Agent you're using to a memory sub-node. The memory connector on the Chat trigger appears when you set Load Previous Session to From Memory. n8n recommends connecting both the Chat trigger and Agent to the same memory sub-node, as this ensures a single source of truth for both nodes.
View screenshot

Response Mode#
Use this option when building a workflow with steps after the agent or chain that's handling the chat. Choose from:
When Last Node Finishes: The Chat Trigger node returns the response code and the data output from the last node executed in the workflow.
Using 'Respond to Webhook' Node: The Chat Trigger node responds as defined in the Respond to Webhook node.
Require Button Click to Start Chat#
Set whether to display a New Conversation button on the chat interface (turned on) or not (turned off).

Set the chat response manually#
You need to manually set the chat response when you don't want to directly send the output of an Agent or Chain node to the user. Instead, you want to take the output of an Agent or Chain node and modify it or do something else with it before sending it back to the user.
In a basic workflow, the Agent and Chain nodes output a parameter named either output or text, and the Chat trigger sends the value of this parameter to the user as the chat response.
If you need to manually create the response sent to the user, you must create a parameter named either text or output. If you use a different parameter name, the Chat trigger sends the entire object as its response, not just the value.
Chat Trigger node common issues#
Here are some common errors and issues with the Chat Trigger node and steps to resolve or troubleshoot them.
Pass data from a website to an embedded Chat Trigger node#
When embedding the Chat Trigger node in a website, you might want to pass extra information to the Chat Trigger. For example, passing a user ID stored in a site cookie.
To do this, use the metadata field in the JSON object you pass to the createChat function in your embedded chat window:
1
2
3
4
5
6
createChat({
	webhookUrl: 'YOUR_PRODUCTION_WEBHOOK_URL',
	metadata: {
		'YOUR_KEY': 'YOUR_DATA'
	};
});



The metadata field can contain arbitrary data that will appear in the Chat Trigger output alongside other output data. From there, you can query and process the data from downstream nodes as usual using n8n's data processing features.
Chat Trigger node doesn't fetch previous messages#
When you configure a Chat Trigger node, you might experience problems fetching previous messages if you aren't careful about how you configure session loading. This often manifests as a workflow could not be started! error.
In Chat Triggers, the Load Previous Session option retrieves previous chat messages for a session using the sessionID. When you set the Load Previous Session option to From memory, it's almost always best to connect the same memory node to both the Chat Trigger and the Agent in your workflow:
In your Chat Trigger node, set the Load Previous Session option to From Memory. This is only visible if you've made the chat publicly available.
Attach a Simple Memory node to the Memory connector.
Attach the same Simple Memory node to Memory connector of your Agent.
In the Simple Memory node, set Session ID to Connected Chat Trigger Node.
One instance where you may want to attach separate memory nodes to your Chat Trigger and the Agent is if you want to set the Session ID in your memory node to Define below.
If you're retrieving the session ID from an expression, the same expression must work for each of the nodes attached to it. If the expression isn't compatible with each of the nodes that need memory, you might need to use separate memory nodes so you can customize the expression for the session ID on a per-node basis.

Edit Fields (Set)#
Use the Edit Fields node to set workflow data. This node can set new data as well as overwrite data that already exists. This node is crucial in workflows which expect incoming data from previous nodes, such as when inserting values to Google Sheets or databases.
Node parameters#
These are the settings and options available in the Edit Fields node.
Mode#
You can either use Manual Mapping to edit fields using the GUI or JSON Output to write JSON that n8n adds to the input data.
Fields to Set#
If you select Mode > Manual Mapping, you can configure the fields by dragging and dropping values from INPUT.
The default behavior when you drag a value is:
n8n sets the value's name as the field name.
The field value contains an expression which accesses the value.
If you don't want to use expressions:
Hover over a field. n8n displays the Fixed | Expressions toggle.
Select Fixed.
You can do this for both the name and value of the field.

Keep Only Set Fields#
Enable this to discard any input data that you don't use in Fields to Set.
Include in Output#
Choose which input data to include in the node's output data.
Node options#
Use these options to customize the behavior of the node.
Include Binary Data#
If the input data includes binary data, choose whether to include it in the Edit Fields node's output data.
Ignore Type Conversion Errors#
Manual Mapping only.
Enabling this allows n8n to ignore some data type errors when mapping fields.
Support Dot Notation#
By default, n8n supports dot notation.
For example, when using manual mapping, the node follows the dot notation for the Name field. That means if you set the name in the Name field as number.one and the value in the Value field as 20, the resulting JSON is:
1
{ "number": { "one": 20} }



You can prevent this behavior by selecting Add Option > Support Dot Notation, and setting the Dot Notion field to off. Now the resulting JSON is:
1
{ "number.one": 20 }

Edit Image#
Use the Edit Image node to manipulate and edit images.
Dependencies
If you aren't running n8n on Docker, you need to install GraphicsMagick.
You need to use a node such as the Read/Write Files from Disk node or the HTTP Request node to pass the image file as a data property to the Edit Image node.

Error Trigger node#
You can use the Error Trigger node to create error workflows. When another linked workflow fails, this node gets details about the failed workflow and the errors, and runs the error workflow.
Usage#
Create a new workflow, with the Error Trigger as the first node.
Give the workflow a name, for example Error Handler.
Select Save.
In the workflow where you want to use this error workflow:
Select Options  > Settings.
In Error workflow, select the workflow you just created. For example, if you used the name Error Handler, select Error handler.
Select Save. Now, when this workflow errors, the related error workflow runs.
Note the following:
If a workflow uses the Error Trigger node, you don't have to activate the workflow.
If a workflow contains the Error Trigger node, by default, the workflow uses itself as the error workflow.
You can't test error workflows when running workflows manually. The Error Trigger only runs when an automatic workflow errors.

Evaluation node#
The Evaluation node performs various operations related to evaluations to validate your AI workflow reliability. You can use the Evaluation node to conditionally execute logic based on whether the workflow is under evaluation, to write evaluation outcomes back to a Google Sheet dataset, or to log scoring metrics for your evaluation performance to n8n's evaluations tab.
Credentials
The Evaluation node's Set Outputs operation uses Google Sheets to record evaluation outcomes. To use that operation, you must configure a Google Sheets credential.
Operations#
The Evaluation node offers the following operations:
Set Outputs: Write the results of an evaluation back to a Google Sheet dataset.
Set Metrics: Record metrics scoring the evaluation performance to n8n's Evaluations tab.
Check If Evaluating: Branches the workflow execution logic depending on whether the current execution is an evaluation.
The parameters and options available depend on the operation you select.
Set Outputs#
The Set Outputs operation has the following parameters:
Credential to connect with: Create or select an existing Google Sheets credentials.
Document Containing Dataset: Choose the spreadsheet document you want to write the evaluation results to. Usually this is the same document you select in the Evaluation Trigger node.
Select From list to choose the spreadsheet title from the dropdown list, By URL to enter the url of the spreadsheet, or By ID to enter the spreadsheetId.
You can find the spreadsheetId in a Google Sheets URL: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/spreadsheetId/edit#gid=0.
Sheet Containing Dataset: Choose the sheet you want to write the evaluation results to. Usually this is the same sheet you select in the Evaluation Trigger node.
Select From list to choose the sheet title from the dropdown list, By URL to enter the url of the sheet, By ID to enter the sheetId, or By Name to enter the sheet title.
You can find the sheetId in a Google Sheets URL: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/aBC-123_xYz/edit#gid=sheetId.
You define the items to write to the Google Sheet in the Outputs section. For each output, you set the following:
Name: The Google Sheet column name to write the evaluation results to.
Value: The value to write to the Google Sheet.
Set Metrics#
The Set Metrics operation includes a Metrics to Return section where you define the metrics to record and track for your evaluations. You can see the metric results in your workflow's Evaluations tab.
For each metric you wish to record, you set the following details:
Name: The name to use for the metric.
Value: The numeric value to record. Once you run your evaluation, you can drag and drop values from previous nodes here. Metric values must be numeric.
Check If Evaluating#
The Check If Evaluating operation does not have any parameters. This operation provides branching output connectors so that you can conditionally execute logic depending on whether the current execution is an evaluation or not.

n8n provides an app node for evaluations. You can find the node docs here.
For common questions or issues and suggested solutions, refer to the evaluations tips and common issues page.
Execute Command#
The Execute Command node runs shell commands on the host machine that runs n8n.
Which shell runs the command?
This node executes the command in the default shell of the host machine. For example, cmd on Windows and zsh on macOS.
If you run n8n with Docker, your command will run in the n8n container and not the Docker host.
Not available on Cloud
This node isn't available on n8n Cloud.
Node parameters#
Configure the node using the following parameters.
Execute Once#
Choose whether you want the node to execute only once (turned on) or once for every item it receives as input (turned off).
Command#
Enter the command to execute on the host machine. Refer to sections below for examples of running multiple commands and cURL commands.
Run multiple commands#
Use one of two methods to run multiple commands in one Execute Command node:
Enter each command on one line separated by &&. For example, you can combine the change directory (cd) command with the list (ls) command using &&.
1
cd bin && ls




Enter each command on a separate line. For example, you can write the list (ls) command on a new line after the change directory (cd) command.
1
2
cd bin
ls



Run cURL command#
You can also use the HTTP Request node to make a cURL request.
If you want to run the curl command in the Execute Command node, you will have to build a Docker image based on the existing n8n image. The default n8n Docker image uses Alpine Linux. You will have to install the curl package.
Create a file named Dockerfile.
Add the below code snippet to the Dockerfile.
1
2
3
4
FROM docker.n8n.io/n8nio/n8n
USER root
RUN apk --update add curl
USER node




In the same folder, execute the command below to build the Docker image.
1
docker build -t n8n-curl




Replace the Docker image you used before. For example, replace docker.n8n.io/n8nio/n8n with n8n-curl.
Run the newly created Docker image. You'll now be able to execute ssh using the Execute Command Node.
Execute Command node common issues#
Here are some common errors and issues with the Execute Command node and steps to resolve or troubleshoot them.
Command failed: <command> /bin/sh: <command>: not found#
This error occurs when the shell environment can't find one of the commands in the Command parameter.
To fix this error, review the following:
Check that the command and its arguments don't have typos in the Command parameter.
Check that the command is in the PATH of the user running n8n.
If you are running n8n with Docker, check if the command is available within the container by trying to run it manually. If your command isn't included in the container, you might have to extend the official n8n image with a custom image that includes your command.
If n8n is already running:
1
2
3
4
# Find n8n's container ID, it will be the first column
docker ps | grep n8n
# Try to execute the command within the running container
docker container exec <container_ID> <command_to_run>



If n8n isn't running:
1
2
3
# Start up a new container that runs the command instead of n8n
# Use the same image and tag that you use to run n8n normally
docker run -it --rm --entrypoint /bin/sh docker.n8n.io/n8nio/n8n -c <command_to_run>



Error: stdout maxBuffer length exceeded#
This error happens when your command returns more output than the Execute Command node is able to process at one time.
To avoid this error, reduce output your command produces. Check your command's manual page or documentation to see if there are flags to limit or filter output. If not, you may need to pipe the output to another command to remove unneeded info.
Execute Sub-workflow#
Use the Execute Sub-workflow node to run a different workflow on the host machine that runs n8n.
Node parameters#
Source#
Select where the node should get the sub-workflow's information from:
Database: Select this option to load the workflow from the database by ID. You must also enter either:
From list: Select the workflow from a list of workflows available to your account.
Workflow ID: Enter the ID for the workflow. The URL of the workflow contains the ID after /workflow/. For example, if the URL of a workflow is https://my-n8n-acct.app.n8n.cloud/workflow/abCDE1f6gHiJKL7, the Workflow ID is abCDE1f6gHiJKL7.
Local File: Select this option to load the workflow from a locally saved JSON file. You must also enter:
Workflow Path: Enter the path to the local JSON workflow file you want the node to execute.
Parameter: Select this option to load the workflow from a parameter. You must also enter:
Workflow JSON: Enter the JSON code you want the node to execute.
URL: Select this option to load the workflow from a URL. You must also enter:
Workflow URL: Enter the URL you want to load the workflow from.
Workflow Inputs#
If you select a sub-workflow using the database and From list options, the sub-workflow's input items will automatically display, ready for you to fill in or map values.
You can optionally remove requested input items, in which case the sub-workflow receives null as the item's value. You can also enable Attempt to convert types to try to automatically convert data to the sub-workflow item's requested type.
Input items won't appear if the sub-workflow's Workflow Input Trigger node uses the "Accept all data" input data mode.
Mode#
Use this parameter to control the execution mode for the node. Choose from these options:
Run once with all items: Pass all input items into a single execution of the node.
Run once for each item: Execute the node once for each input item in turn.
Node options#
This node includes one option: Wait for Sub-Workflow Completion. This lets you control whether the main workflow should wait for the sub-workflow's completion before moving on to the next step (turned on) or whether the main workflow should continue without waiting (turned off).

Set up and use a sub-workflow#
This section walks through setting up both the parent workflow and sub-workflow.
Create the sub-workflow#
Create a new workflow.
Create sub-workflows from existing workflows
You can optionally create a sub-workflow directly from an existing parent workflow using the Execute Sub-workflow node. In the node, select the Database and From list options and select Create a sub-workflow in the list.
You can also extract selected nodes directly using Sub-workflow conversion in the context menu.
Optional: configure which workflows can call the sub-workflow:
Select the Options  menu > Settings. n8n opens the Workflow settings modal.
Change the This workflow can be called by setting. Refer to Workflow settings for more information on configuring your workflows.
Add the Execute Sub-workflow trigger node (if you are searching under trigger nodes, this is also titled When Executed by Another Workflow).
Set the Input data mode to choose how you will define the sub-workflow's input data:
Define using fields below: Choose this mode to define individual input names and data types that the calling workflow needs to provide. The Execute Sub-workflow node or Call n8n Workflow Tool node in the calling workflow will automatically pull in the fields defined here.
Define using JSON example: Choose this mode to provide an example JSON object that demonstrates the expected input items and their types.
Accept all data: Choose this mode to accept all data unconditionally. The sub-workflow won't define any required input items. This sub-workflow must handle any input inconsistencies or missing values.
Add other nodes as needed to build your sub-workflow functionality.
Save the sub-workflow.
Sub-workflow mustn't contain errors
If there are errors in the sub-workflow, the parent workflow can't trigger it.
Load data into sub-workflow before building
This requires the ability to load data from previous executions, which is available on n8n Cloud and registered Community plans.
If you want to load data into your sub-workflow to use while building it:
Create the sub-workflow and add the Execute Sub-workflow Trigger.
Set the node's Input data mode to Accept all data or define the input items using fields or JSON if they're already known.
In the sub-workflow settings, set Save successful production executions to Save.
Skip ahead to setting up the parent workflow, and run it.
Follow the steps to load data from previous executions.
Adjust the Input data mode to match the input sent by the parent workflow if necessary.
You can now pin example data in the trigger node, enabling you to work with real data while configuring the rest of the workflow.
Call the sub-workflow#
Open the workflow where you want to call the sub-workflow.
Add the Execute Sub-workflow node.
In the Execute Sub-workflow node, set the sub-workflow you want to call. You can choose to call the workflow by ID, load a workflow from a local file, add workflow JSON as a parameter in the node, or target a workflow by URL.
Find your workflow ID
Your sub-workflow's ID is the alphanumeric string at the end of its URL.
Fill in the required input items defined by the sub-workflow.
Save your workflow.
When your workflow executes, it will send data to the sub-workflow, and run it.
You can follow the execution flow from the parent workflow to the sub-workflow by opening the Execute Sub-workflow node and selecting the View sub-execution link. Likewise, the sub-workflow's execution contains a link back to the parent workflow's execution to navigate in the other direction.
How data passes between workflows#
As an example, imagine you have an Execute Sub-workflow node in Workflow A. The Execute Sub-workflow node calls another workflow called Workflow B:
The Execute Sub-workflow node passes the data to the Execute Sub-workflow Trigger node (titled "When executed by another node" in the canvas) of Workflow B.
The last node of Workflow B sends the data back to the Execute Sub-workflow node in Workflow A.
Execute Sub-workflow Trigger node#
Use this node to start a workflow in response to another workflow. It should be the first node in the workflow.
n8n allows you to call workflows from other workflows. This is useful if you want to:
Reuse a workflow: for example, you could have multiple workflows pulling and processing data from different sources, then have all those workflows call a single workflow that generates a report.
Break large workflows into smaller components.
Usage#
This node runs in response to a call from the Execute Sub-workflow or Call n8n Workflow Tool nodes.
Create the sub-workflow#
Create a new workflow.
Create sub-workflows from existing workflows
You can optionally create a sub-workflow directly from an existing parent workflow using the Execute Sub-workflow node. In the node, select the Database and From list options and select Create a sub-workflow in the list.
You can also extract selected nodes directly using Sub-workflow conversion in the context menu.
Optional: configure which workflows can call the sub-workflow:
Select the Options  menu > Settings. n8n opens the Workflow settings modal.
Change the This workflow can be called by setting. Refer to Workflow settings for more information on configuring your workflows.

The Execute Sub-workflow node passes the data to the Execute Sub-workflow Trigger node (titled "When executed by another node" in the canvas) of Workflow B.
The last node of Workflow B sends the data back to the Execute Sub-workflow node in Workflow A.
Execution Data#
Use this node to save metadata for workflow executions. You can then search by this data in the Executions list.
You can retrieve custom execution data during workflow execution using the Code node. Refer to Custom executions data for more information.
Feature availability
Available on Pro and Enterprise plans.
Operations#
Save Execution Data for Search
Data to Save#
Add a Saved Field for each key/value pair of metadata you'd like to save.
Limitations#
The Execution Data node has the following restrictions when storing execution metadata:
key: limited to 50 characters
value: limited to 512 characters
If either the key or value exceed the above limitations, n8n truncates to their maximum length and outputs a log entry.
Extract From File#
A common pattern in n8n workflows is to receive a file, either from and HTTP Request node (for files you are fetching from a website), a Webhook Node (for files which are sent to your workflow from elsewhere), or from a local source. Data obtained in this way is often in a binary format, for example a spreadsheet or PDF.
The Extract From File node extracts data from a binary format file and converts it to JSON, which can then be easily manipulated by the rest of your workflow. For converting JSON back into a binary file type, please see the Convert to File node.
Operations#
Use the Operations drop-down to select the format of the source file to extract data from.
Extract From CSV: The "Comma Separated Values" file type is commonly used for tabulated data.
Extract From HTML: Extract fields from standard web page HTML format files.
Extract From JSON: Extract JSON data from a binary file.
Extract From ICS: Extract fields from iCalendar format files.
Extract From ODS: Extract fields from ODS spreadsheet files.
Extract From PDF: Extract fields from Portable Document Format files.
Extract From RTF: Extract fields from Rich Text Format files.
Extract From Text File: Extract fields from a standard text file format.
Extract From XLS: Extract fields from a Microsoft Excel file (older format).
Extract From XLSX: Extract fields from a Microsoft Excel file.
Move File to Base64 String: Converts binary data to a text-friendly base64 format.

In this example, a Webhook node is used to trigger the workflow. When a CSV file is sent to the webhook address, the file data is output and received by the Extract From File node.
Click to explore
View workflow file
Set to operate as 'Extract from CSV', the node then outputs the data as a series of JSON 'row' objects:
1
2
3
4
5
6
7
8
{
  "row": {
  "0": "apple",
  "1": "1",
  "2": "2",
  "3": "3"
  }
  ...



Receiving files with a webhook
Select the Webhook Node's Add Options button and select Raw body, then enable that setting to get the node to output the binary file that the subsequent node is expecting.
Node parameters#
Input Binary Field#
Enter the name of the field from the node input data that contains the binary file. The default is 'data'.
Destination Output Field#
Enter the name of the field in the node output that will contain the extracted data.
This parameter is only available for these operations:
Extract From JSON
Extract From ICS
Extract From Text File
Move File to Base64 String
Filter#
Filter items based on a condition. If the item meets the condition, the Filter node passes it on to the next node in the Filter node output. If the item doesn't meet the condition, the Filter node omits the item from its output.
Node parameters#
Create filter comparison Conditions to perform your filter.
Use the data type dropdown to select the data type and comparison operation type for your condition. For example, to filter for dates after a particular date, select Date & Time > is after.
The fields and values to enter into the condition change based on the data type and comparison you select. Refer to Available data type comparisons for a full list of all comparisons by data type.
Select Add condition to create more conditions.
Combining conditions#
You can choose to keep items:
When they meet all conditions: Create two or more conditions and select AND in the dropdown between them.
When they meet any of the conditions: Create two or more conditions and select OR in the dropdown between them.
You can't create a mix of AND and OR rules.
Node options#
Ignore Case: Whether to ignore letter case (turned on) or be case sensitive (turned off).
Less Strict Type Validation: Whether you want n8n to attempt to convert value types based on the operator you choose (turned on) or not (turned off). Turn this on when facing a "wrong type:" error in your node.

JSON: Select this option to format the response as JSON.
Text: Select this option to format the response as plain text. Enter the field name where you want the file returned in Put Output in Field.
Pagination#
Use this option to paginate results, useful for handling query results that are too big for the API to return in a single call.
Inspect the API data first
Some options for pagination require knowledge of the data returned by the API you're using. Before setting up pagination, either check the API documentation, or do an API call without pagination, to see the data it returns.
Understand pagination
Configure the pagination settings:
Pagination Mode:
Off: Turn off pagination.
Update a Parameter in Each Request: Use this when you need to dynamically set parameters for each request.
Response Contains Next URL: Use this when the API response includes the URL of the next page. Use an expression to set Next URL.
For example setups, refer to HTTP Request node cookbook | Pagination.
n8n provides built-in variables for working with HTTP node requests and responses when using pagination:
Variable
Description
$pageCount
The pagination count. Tracks how many pages the node has fetched.
$request
The request object sent by the HTTP node.
$response
The response object from the HTTP call. Includes $response.body, $response.headers, and $response.statusCode. The contents of body and headers depend on the data sent by the API.

API differences
Different APIs implement pagination in different ways. Check the API documentation for the API you're using for details. You need to find out things like:
Does the API provide the URL for the next page?
Are there API-specific limits on page size or page number?
The structure of the data that the API returns.
Proxy#
Use this option if you need to specify an HTTP proxy.
Enter the Proxy the request should use.
Timeout#
Use this option to set how long the node should wait for the server to send response headers (and start the response body). The node aborts requests that exceed this value for the initial response.
Enter the Timeout time to wait in milliseconds.
Tool-only options#
The following options are only available when attached to an AI agent as a tool.
Optimize Response#
Whether to optimize the tool response to reduce the amount of data passed to the LLM. Optimizing the response can reduce costs and can help the LLM ignore unimportant details, often leading to better results.
When optimizing responses, you select an expected response type, which determines other options you can configure. The supported response types are:
JSON#
When expecting a JSON response, you can configure which parts of the JSON data to use as a response with the following choices:
Field Containing Data: This field identifies a specific part of the JSON object that contains your relevant data. You can leave this blank to use the entire response.
Include Fields: This is how you choose which fields you want in your response object. There are three choices:
All: Include all fields in the response object.
Selected: Include only the fields specified below.
Fields: A comma-separated list of fields to include in the response. You can use dot notation to specify nested fields. You can drag fields from the Input panel to add them to the field list.
Exclude: Include all fields except the fields specified below.
Fields: A comma-separated list of fields to exclude from the response. You can use dot notation to specify nested fields. You can drag fields from the Input panel to add them to the field list.
HTML#
When expecting HTML, you can identify the part of an HTML document relevant to the LLM and optimize the response with the following options:
Selector (CSS): A specific element or element type to include in the response HTML. Uses the body element by default.
Return Only Content: Whether to strip HTML tags and attributes from the response, leaving only the actual content. This uses fewer tokens and may be easier for the model to understand.
Elements To Omit: A comma-separated list of CSS selectors to exclude when extracting content.
Truncate Response: Whether to limit the response size to save tokens.
Max Response Characters: The maximum number of characters to include in the HTML response. The default value is 1000.
Text#
When expecting a generic Text response, you can optimize the results with the following options:
Truncate Response: Whether to limit the response size to save tokens.
Max Response Characters: The maximum number of characters to include in the HTML response. The default value is 1000.
Import curl command#
curl is a command line tool and library for transferring data with URLs.
You can use curl to call REST APIs. If the API documentation of the service you want to use provides curl examples, you can copy them out of the documentation and into n8n to configure the HTTP Request node.
Import a curl command:
From the HTTP Request node's Parameters tab, select Import cURL. The Import cURL command modal opens.
Paste your curl command into the text box.
Select Import. n8n loads the request configuration into the node fields. This overwrites any existing configuration.
HTTP Request node common issues#
Here are some common errors and issues with the HTTP Request node and steps to resolve or troubleshoot them.
Bad request - please check your parameters#
This error displays when the node receives a 400 error indicating a bad request. This error most often occurs because:
You're using an invalid name or value in a Query Parameter.
You're passing array values in a Query Parameter but the array isn't formatted correctly. Try using the Array Format in Query Parameters option.
Review the API documentation for your service to format your query parameters.
The resource you are requesting could not be found#
This error displays when the endpoint URL you entered is invalid.
This may be due to a typo in the URL or a deprecated API. Refer to your service's API documentation to verify you have a valid endpoint.
JSON parameter need to be an valid JSON#
This error displays when you've passed a parameter as JSON and it's not formatted as valid JSON.
To resolve, review the JSON you've entered for these issues:
Test your JSON in a JSON checker or syntax parser to find errors like missing quotation marks, extra or missing commas, incorrectly formatted arrays, extra or missing square brackets or curly brackets, and so on.
If you've used an Expression in the node, be sure you've wrapped the entire JSON in double curly brackets, for example:
1
 2
 3
 4
 5
 6
 7
 8
 9
10
11
{{
    {
    "myjson":
    {
        "name1": "value1",
        "name2": "value2",
        "array1":
            ["value1","value2"]
    }
    }
}}



Forbidden - perhaps check your credentials#
This error displays when the node receives a 403 error indicating authentication failed.
To resolve, review the selected credentials and make sure you can authenticate with them. You may need to:
Update permissions or scopes so that your API key or account can perform the operation you've selected.
Format your generic credential in a different way.
Generate a new API key or token with the appropriate permissions or scopes.
429 - The service is receiving too many requests from you#
This error displays when the node receives a 429 error from the service that you're calling. This often means that you have hit the rate limits of that service. You can find out more on the Handling API rate limits page.
To resolve the error, you can use one of the built-in options of the HTTP request node:
Batching#
Use this option to send requests in batches and introduce a delay between them.
In the HTTP Request node, select Add Option > Batching.
Set Items per Batch to the number of input items to include in each request.
Set Batch Interval (ms) to introduce a delay between requests in milliseconds. For example, to send one request to an API per second, set Batch Interval (ms) to 1000.
Retry on Fail#
Use this option to retry the node after a failed attempt.
In the HTTP Request node, go to Settings and enable Retry on Fail.
Set Max Tries to the maximum number of times n8n should retry the node.
Set Wait Between Tries (ms) to the desired delay in milliseconds between retries. For example, to wait one second before retrying the request again, set Wait Between Tries (ms) to 1000.
If#
Use the If node to split a workflow conditionally based on comparison operations.
Add conditions#
Create comparison Conditions for your If node.
Use the data type dropdown to select the data type and comparison operation type for your condition. For example, to filter for dates after a particular date, select Date & Time > is after.
The fields and values to enter into the condition change based on the data type and comparison you select. Refer to Available data type comparisons for a full list of all comparisons by data type.
Select Add condition to create more conditions.
Combining conditions#
You can choose to keep data:
When it meets all conditions: Create two or more conditions and select AND in the dropdown between them.
When it meets any of the conditions: Create two or more conditions and select OR in the dropdown between them.

Branch execution with If and Merge nodes#
0.236.0 and below
n8n removed this execution behavior in version 1.0. This section applies to workflows using the v0 (legacy) workflow execution order. By default, this is all workflows built before version 1.0. You can change the execution order in your workflow settings.
If you add a Merge node to a workflow containing an If node, it can result in both output data streams of the If node executing.
One data stream triggers the Merge node, which then goes and executes the other data stream.
For example, in the screenshot below there's a workflow containing an Edit Fields node, If node, and Merge node. The standard If node behavior is to execute one data stream (in the screenshot, this is the true output). However, due to the Merge node, both data streams execute, despite the If node not sending any data down the false data stream.

Items are only compared against previous executions
The current input items are only compared against the stored items from previous executions. This means that items repeated within the current input aren't removed in this mode of operation. If you need to remove duplicate items within the current input and across executions, connect two Remove Duplicate nodes together sequentially. Set the first to use the Remove Items Repated Within Current Input operation and the second to use the Remove Items Processed in Previous Executions operation.
Open the Code node and uncomment (remove the // from) the line for "Tom Hanks."
On the canvas, select Execute workflow again. Open the Remove Duplicates node again to examine the results.

RSS Feed Trigger node#
The RSS Feed Trigger node allows you to start an n8n workflow when a new RSS feed item has been published.
On this page, you'll find a list of operations the RSS Feed Trigger node supports, and links to more resources.
Node parameters#
Poll Times: Select a poll Mode to set how often to trigger the poll. Your Mode selection will add or remove relevant fields. Refer to the sections below to configure the parameters for each mode type.
Feed URL: Enter the URL of the RSS feed to poll.
Every Hour mode#
Enter the Minute of the hour to trigger the poll, from 0 to 59.
Every Day mode#
Enter the Hour of the day to trigger the poll in 24-hour format, from 0 to 23.
Enter the Minute of the hour to trigger the poll, from 0 to 59.
Every Week mode#
Enter the Hour of the day to trigger the poll in 24-hour format, from 0 to 23.
Enter the Minute of the hour to trigger the poll, from 0 to 59.
Select the Weekday to trigger the poll.
Every Month mode#
Enter the Hour of the day to trigger the poll in 24-hour format, from 0 to 23.
Enter the Minute of the hour to trigger the poll, from 0 to 59.
Enter the Day of the Month to trigger the poll, from 0 to 31.
Every X mode#
Enter the Value of measurement for how often to trigger the poll in either minutes or hours.
Select the Unit for the value. Supported units are Minutes and Hours.
Custom mode#
Enter a custom Cron Expression to trigger the poll. Use these values and ranges:
Seconds: 0 - 59
Minutes: 0 - 59
Hours: 0 - 23
Day of Month: 1 - 31
Months: 0 - 11 (Jan - Dec)
Day of Week: 0 - 6 (Sun - Sat)
To generate a Cron expression, you can use crontab guru. Paste the Cron expression that you generated using crontab guru in the Cron Expression field in n8n.
Examples#
If you want to trigger your workflow every day at 04:08:30, enter the following in the Cron Expression field.
1
30 8 4 * * *



If you want to trigger your workflow every day at 04:08, enter the following in the Cron Expression field.
1
8 4 * * *



Why there are six asterisks in the Cron expression#
The sixth asterisk in the Cron expression represents seconds. Setting this is optional. The node will execute even if you don't set the value for seconds.

day of week

Schedule Trigger node#
Use the Schedule Trigger node to run workflows at fixed intervals and times. This works in a similar way to the Cron software utility in Unix-like systems.
You must activate the workflow
If a workflow uses the Schedule node as a trigger, make sure that you save and activate the workflow.
Timezone settings
The node relies on the timezone setting. n8n uses either:
The workflow timezone, if set. Refer to Workflow settings for more information.
The n8n instance timezone, if the workflow timezone isn't set. The default is America/New York for self-hosted instances. n8n Cloud tries to detect the instance owner's timezone when they sign up, falling back to GMT as the default. Self-hosted users can change the instance setting using Environment variables. Cloud admins can change the instance timezone in the Admin dashboard.
Node parameters#
Add Trigger Rules to determine when the trigger should run.
Use the Trigger Interval to select the time interval unit of measure to schedule the trigger for. All other parameters depend on the interval you select. Choose from:
Seconds trigger interval
Minutes trigger interval
Hours trigger interval
Days trigger interval
Weeks trigger interval
Months trigger interval
Custom (Cron) interval
You can add multiple Trigger Rules to run the node on different schedules.
Refer to the sections below for more detail on configuring each Trigger Interval. Refer to Templates and examples for further examples.
Seconds trigger interval#
Seconds Between Triggers: Enter the number of seconds between each workflow trigger. For example, if you enter 30 here, the trigger will run every 30 seconds.
Minutes trigger interval#
Minutes Between Triggers: Enter the number of minutes between each workflow trigger. For example, if you enter 5 here, the trigger will run every 5 minutes.
Hours trigger interval#
Hours Between Triggers: Enter the number of hours between each workflow trigger.
Trigger at Minute: Enter the minute past the hour to trigger the node when it runs, from 0 to 59.
For example, if you enter 6 Hours Between Triggers and 30 Trigger at Minute, the node will run every six hours at 30 minutes past the hour.
Days trigger interval#
Days Between Triggers: Enter the number of days between each workflow trigger.
Trigger at Hour: Select the hour of the day to trigger the node.
Trigger at Minute: Enter the minute past the hour to trigger the node when it runs, from 0 to 59.
For example, if you enter 2 Days Between Triggers, 9am for Trigger at Hour, and 15 Trigger at Minute, the node will run every two days at 9:15am.
Weeks trigger interval#
Weeks Between Triggers: Enter the number of weeks between each workflow trigger.
Trigger on Weekdays: Select the day(s) of the week you want to trigger the node.
Trigger at Hour: Select the hour of the day to trigger the node.
Trigger at Minute: Enter the minute past the hour to trigger the node when it runs, from 0 to 59.
For example, if you enter 2 Weeks Between Triggers, Monday for Trigger on Weekdays, 3pm for Trigger at Hour, and 30 Trigger at Minute, the node will run every two weeks on Monday at 3:30 PM.
Months trigger interval#
Months Between Triggers: Enter the number of months between each workflow trigger.
Trigger at Day of Month: Enter the day of the month the day should trigger at, from 1 to 31. If a month doesn't have this day, the node won't trigger. For example, if you enter 30 here, the node won't trigger in February.
Trigger at Hour: Select the hour of the day to trigger the node.
Trigger at Minute: Enter the minute past the hour to trigger the node when it runs, from 0 to 59.
For example, if you enter 3 Months Between Triggers, 28 Trigger at Day of Month, 9am for Trigger at Hour, and 0 Trigger at Minute, the node will run each quarter on the 28th day of the month at 9:00 AM.
Custom (Cron) interval#
Enter a custom cron Expression to set the schedule for the trigger.
To generate a Cron expression, you can use crontab guru. Paste the Cron expression that you generated using crontab guru in the Expression field in n8n.

Using variables in the Cron expression
While variables can be used in the scheduled trigger, their values only get evaluated when the workflow is activated. If you alter a variable's value in the settings after a workflow is activated, the changes won't alter the cron schedule. To re-evaluate the variable, set the workflow to Inactive and then back to Active again
Why there are six asterisks in the Cron expression#
The sixth asterisk in the Cron expression represents seconds. Setting this is optional. The node will execute even if you don't set the value for seconds.

Schedule Trigger node common issues#
Here are some common errors and issues with the Schedule Trigger node and steps to resolve or troubleshoot them.
Invalid cron expression#
This error occurs when you set Trigger Interval to Custom (Cron) and n8n doesn't understand your cron expression. This may mean that there is a mistake in your cron expression or that you're using an incompatible syntax.
To debug, check that the following:
That your cron expression follows the syntax used in the cron examples
That your cron expression (after removing the seconds column) validates on crontab guru
Scheduled workflows run at the wrong time#
If the Schedule Trigger node runs at the wrong time, it may mean that you need to adjust the time zone n8n uses.
Adjust the timezone globally#
If you're using n8n Cloud, follow the instructions on the set the Cloud instance timezone page to ensure that n8n executes in sync with your local time.
If you're self hosting, set your global timezone using the GENERIC_TIMEZONE environment variable.
Adjust the timezone for an individual workflow#
To set the timezone for an individual workflow:
Open the workflow on the canvas.
Select the  Three dots icon in the upper-right corner.
Select Settings.
Change the Timezone setting.
Select Save.
Variables not working as expected#
While variables can be used in the scheduled trigger, their values only get evaluated when the workflow is activated. After activating the worfklow, you can alter a variable's value in the settings but it won't change how often the workflow runs. To work around this, you must stop and then re-activate the workflow to apply the updated variable value.
Changing the trigger interval#
You can update the scheduled trigger interval at any time but it only gets updated when the workflow is activated. If you change the trigger interval after the workflow is active, the changes won't take effect until you stop and then re-activate the workflow.
Also, the schedule begins from the time when you activate the workflow. For example, if you had originally set a schedule of every 1 hour and it should execute at 12:00, if you changed it to a 2 hour schedule and re-activated the workflow at 11:30, the next execution will be at 13:30, 2 hours from when you activated it.

Refer to Time-based operations for more detail on the timezone used.
On Webhook Call#
This parameter enables your workflows to resume when the Wait node receives an HTTP call.
The webhook URL that resumes the execution when called is generated at runtime. The Wait node provides the $execution.resumeUrl variable so that you can reference and send the yet-to-be-generated URL wherever needed, for example to a third-party service or in an email.
When the workflow executes, the Wait node generates the resume URL and the webhook(s) in your workflow using the $execution.resumeUrl. This generated URL is unique to each execution, so your workflow can contain multiple Wait nodes and as the webhook URL is called it will resume each Wait node sequentially.
For this Resume style, set more parameters listed below.
Authentication#
Select if and how incoming resume-webhook-requests to $execution.resumeUrl should be authenticated. Options include:
Basic Auth: Use basic authentication. Select or enter a new Credential for Basic Auth to use.

No Response Body: Set whether n8n should send a body in the response (turned off) or prevent n8n from sending a body in the response (turned on).
Raw Body: Set whether to return the body in a raw format like JSON or XML (turned on) or not (turned off).
Response Data: Enter any custom data you want to send in the response.
Response Headers: Send more headers in the webhook response. Refer to MDN Web Docs | Response header to learn more about response headers.
Webhook Suffix: Enter a suffix to append to the resume URL. This is useful for creating unique webhook URLs for each Wait node when a workflow contains multiple Wait nodes. Note that the generated $resumeWebhookUrl won't automatically include this suffix, you must manually append it to the webhook URL before exposing it.
On Webhook Call limitations#
There are some limitations to keep in mind when using On Webhook Call:
Partial executions of your workflow changes the $resumeWebhookUrl, so be sure that the node sending this URL to your desired third-party runs in the same execution as the Wait node.
On Form Submitted#
Wait for a form submission before continuing. Set up these parameters:
Form Title#
Enter the title to display at the top of the form.
Form Description#
Enter a form description to display beneath the title. This description can help prompt the user on how to complete the form.

On Form Response options#
Form Response: Choose how and what you want the form to Respond With from these options:
Form Submitted Text: The form displays whatever text is entered in Text to Show after a user fills out the form. Use this option if you want to display a confirmation message.
Redirect URL: The form will redirect the user to the URL to Redirect to after they fill out the form. This must be a valid URL.
Webhook Suffix: Enter a suffix to append to the resume URL. This is useful for creating unique webhook URLs for each Wait node when a workflow contains multiple Wait nodes. Note that the generated $resumeWebhookUrl won't automatically include this suffix, you must manually append it to the webhook URL before exposing it.

Time-based operations#
For the time-based resume operations, note that:
For wait times less than 65 seconds, the workflow doesn't offload execution data to the database. Instead, the process continues to run and the execution resumes after the specified interval passes.
The n8n server time is always used regardless of the timezone setting. Workflow timezone settings, and any changes made to them, don't affect the Wait node interval or specified time.
Webhook node#
Use the Webhook node to create webhooks, which can receive data from apps and services when an event occurs. It's a trigger node, which means it can start an n8n workflow. This allows services to connect to n8n and run a workflow.
You can use the Webhook node as a trigger for a workflow when you want to receive data and run a workflow based on the data. The Webhook node also supports returning the data generated at the end of a workflow. This makes it useful for building a workflow to process data and return the results, like an API endpoint.
The webhook allows you to trigger workflows from services that don't have a dedicated app trigger node.
Workflow development process#
n8n provides different Webhook URLs for testing and production. The testing URL includes an option to Listen for test event. Refer to Workflow development for more information on building, testing, and shifting your Webhook node to production.
Node parameters#
Use these parameters to configure your node.
Webhook URLs#
The Webhook node has two Webhook URLs: test and production. n8n displays the URLs at the top of the node panel.
Select Test URL or Production URL to toggle which URL n8n displays.
Sample Webhook URLs in the Webhook node's Parameters tab
Test: n8n registers a test webhook when you select Listen for Test Event or Execute workflow, if the workflow isn't active. When you call the webhook URL, n8n displays the data in the workflow.
Production: n8n registers a production webhook when you activate the workflow. When using the production URL, n8n doesn't display the data in the workflow. You can still view workflow data for a production execution: select the Executions tab in the workflow, then select the workflow execution you want to view.
HTTP Method#
The Webhook node supports standard HTTP Request Methods:
DELETE
GET
HEAD
PATCH
POST
PUT
Webhook max payload
The webhook maximum payload size is 16MB. If you're self-hosting n8n, you can change this using the endpoint environment variable N8N_PAYLOAD_SIZE_MAX.
Path#
By default, this field contains a randomly generated webhook URL path, to avoid conflicts with other webhook nodes.
You can manually specify a URL path, including adding route parameters. For example, you may need to do this if you use n8n to prototype an API and want consistent endpoint URLs.
The Path field can take the following formats:
/:variable
/path/:variable
/:variable/path
/:variable1/path/:variable2
/:variable1/:variable2
Supported authentication methods#
You can require authentication for any service calling your webhook URL. Choose from these authentication methods:
Basic auth
Header auth
JWT auth
None
Refer to Webhook credentials for more information on setting up each credential type.
Respond#
Immediately: The Webhook node returns the response code and the message Workflow got started.
When Last Node Finishes: The Webhook node returns the response code and the data output from the last node executed in the workflow.
Using 'Respond to Webhook' Node: The Webhook node responds as defined in the Respond to Webhook node.
Response Code#
Customize the HTTP response code that the Webhook node returns upon successful execution. Select from common response codes or create a custom code.
Response Data#
Choose what data to include in the response body:
All Entries: The Webhook returns all the entries of the last node in an array.
First Entry JSON: The Webhook returns the JSON data of the first entry of the last node in a JSON object.
First Entry Binary: The Webhook returns the binary data of the first entry of the last node in a binary file.
No Response Body: The Webhook returns without a body.
Applies only to Respond > When Last Node Finishes.
Node options#
Select Add Option to view more configuration options. The available options depend on your node parameters. Refer to the table for option availability.
Allowed Origins (CORS): Set the permitted cross-origin domains. Enter a comma-separated list of URLs allowed for cross-origin non-preflight requests. Use * (default) to allow all origins.
Binary Property: Enabling this setting allows the Webhook node to receive binary data, such as an image or audio file. Enter the name of the binary property to write the data of the received file to.
Ignore Bots: Ignore requests from bots like link previewers and web crawlers.
IP(s) Whitelist: Enable this to limit who (or what) can invoke a Webhook trigger URL. Enter a comma-separated list of allowed IP addresses. Access from IP addresses outside the whitelist throws a 403 error. If left blank, all IP addresses can invoke the webhook trigger URL.
No Response Body: Enable this to prevent n8n sending a body with the response.
Raw Body: Specify that the Webhook node will receive data in a raw format, such as JSON or XML.
Response Content-Type: Choose the format for the webhook body.
Response Data: Send custom data with the response.
Response Headers: Send extra headers in the Webhook response. Refer to MDN Web Docs | Response header to learn more about response headers.

Workflow development#
The Webhook node works a bit differently from other core nodes. n8n recommends following these processes for building, testing, and using your Webhook node in production.
n8n generates two Webhook URLs for each Webhook node: a Test URL and a Production URL.
Build and test workflows#
While building or testing a workflow, use the Test webhook URL.
Using a test webhook ensures that you can view the incoming data in the editor UI, which is useful for debugging. Select Listen for test event to register the webhook before sending the data to the test webhook. The test webhook stays active for 120 seconds.
When using the Webhook node on localhost on a self-hosted n8n instance, run n8n in tunnel mode:
npm with tunnel
Docker with tunnel
Production workflows#
When your workflow is ready, switch to using the Production webhook URL. You can then activate your workflow, and n8n runs it automatically when an external service calls the webhook URL.
When working with a Production webhook, ensure that you have saved and activated the workflow. Data flowing through the webhook isn't visible in the editor UI with the production webhook.
Refer to Create a workflow for more information on activating workflows.
Common issues and questions#
Here are some common issues and questions for the Webhook node and suggested solutions.
Listen for multiple HTTP methods#
By default, the Webhook node accepts calls that use a single method. For example, it can accept GET or POST requests, but not both. If you want to accept calls using multiple methods:
Open the node Settings.
Turn on Allow Multiple HTTP Methods.
Return to Parameters. By default, the node now accepts GET and POST calls. You can add other methods in the HTTP Methods field.
The Webhook node has an output for each method, so you can perform different actions depending on the method.
Use the HTTP Request node to trigger the Webhook node#
The HTTP Request node makes HTTP requests to the URL you specify.
Create a new workflow.
Add the HTTP Request node to the workflow.
Select a method from the Request Method dropdown list. For example, if you select GET as the HTTP method in your Webhook node, select GET as the request method in the HTTP Request node.
Copy the URL from the Webhook node, and paste it in the URL field in the HTTP Request node.
If using the test URL for the webhook node: execute the workflow with the Webhook node.
Execute the HTTP Request node.
Use curl to trigger the Webhook node#
You can use curl to make HTTP requests that trigger the Webhook node.
Note
In the examples, replace <https://your-n8n.url/webhook/path> with your webhook URL.
The examples make GET requests. You can use whichever HTTP method you set in HTTP Method.
Make an HTTP request without any parameters:
1
curl --request GET <https://your-n8n.url/webhook/path>



Make an HTTP request with a body parameter:
1
curl --request GET <https://your-n8n.url/webhook/path> --data 'key=value'



Make an HTTP request with header parameter:
1
curl --request GET <https://your-n8n.url/webhook/path> --header 'key=value'



Make an HTTP request to send a file:
1
curl --request GET <https://your-n8n.url/webhook/path> --from 'key=@/path/to/file'



Replace /path/to/file with the path of the file you want to send.
Send a response of type string#
By default, the response format is JSON or an array. To send a response of type string:
Select Response Mode > When Last Node Finishes.
Select Response Data > First Entry JSON.
Select Add Option > Property Name.
Enter the name of the property that contains the response. This defaults to data.
Connect an Edit Fields node to the Webhook node.
In the Edit Fields node, select Add Value > String.
Enter the name of the property in the Name field. The name should match the property name from step 4.
Enter the string value in the Value field.
Toggle Keep Only Set to on (green).
When you call the Webhook, it sends the string response from the Edit Fields node.
Test URL versus Production URL#
n8n generates two Webhook URLs for each Webhook node: a Test URL and a Production URL.
While building or testing a workflow, use the Test URL. Once you're ready to use your Webhook URL in production, use the Production URL.

Listening duration
Data shown in editor UI?
Test URL
Select Listen for test event and trigger a test event from the source.

Until workflow deactivated


Refer to Workflow development for more information.
IP addresses in whitelist are failing to connect#
If you're unable to connect from IP addresses in your IP whitelist, check if you are running n8n behind a reverse proxy.
If so, set the N8N_PROXY_HOPS environment variable to the number of reverse-proxies n8n is running behind.
Only one webhook per path and method#
n8n only permits registering one webhook for each path and HTTP method combination (for example, a GET request for /my-request). This avoids ambiguity over which webhook should receive requests.
If you receive a message that the path and method you chose are already in use, you can either:
Deactivate the workflow with the conflicting webhook.
Change the webhook path and/or method for one of the conflicting webhooks.
Workflow Trigger node#
The Workflow Trigger node gets triggered when a workflow is updated or activated.
Deprecated
n8n has deprecated the Workflow Trigger node and moved its functionality to the n8n Trigger node.
Keep in mind
If you want to use the Workflow Trigger node for a workflow, add the node to the workflow. You don't have to create a separate workflow.
The Workflow Trigger node gets triggered for the workflow that it gets added to. You can use the Workflow Trigger node to trigger a workflow to notify the state of the workflow.
Node parameters#
The node includes a single parameter to identify the Events that should trigger it. Choose from these events:
Active Workflow Updated: If you select this event, the node triggers when this workflow is updated.
Workflow Activated: If you select this event, the node triggers when this workflow is activated.
You can select one or both of these events.
XML#
Use the XML node to convert data from and to XML.
Binary files
If your XML is within a binary file, use the Extract from File node to convert it to text first.
Node parameters#
Mode: The format the data should be converted from and to.
JSON to XML: Converts data from JSON to XML.
XML to JSON: Converts data from XML to JSON.
Property Name: Enter the name of the property which contains the data to convert.
Node options#
These options are available regardless of the Mode you select:
Attribute Key: Enter the prefix used to access the attributes. Default is $.
Character Key: Enter the prefix used to access the character content. Default is _.
All other options depend on the selected Mode.
JSON to XML options#
These options only appear if you select JSON to XML as the Mode:
Allow Surrogate Chars: Set whether to allow using characters from the Unicode surrogate blocks (turned on) or not (turned off).
Cdata: Set whether to wrap text nodes in <![CDATA[ ... ]]> instead of escaping when it's required (turned on) or not (turned off).
Turning this option on doesn't add <![CDATA[ ... ]]> if it's not required.
Headless: Set whether to omit the XML header (turned on) or include it (turned off).
Root Name: Enter the root element name to use.
XML to JSON options#
These options only appear if you select XML to JSON as the Mode:
Explicit Array: Set whether to put child nodes in an array (turned on) or create an array only if there's more than one child node (turned off).
Explicit Root: Set whether to get the root node in the resulting object (turned on) or not (turned off).
Ignore Attributes: Set whether to ignore all XML attributes and only create text nodes (turned on) or not (turned off).
Merge Attributes: Set whether to merge attributes and child elements as properties of the parent (turned on) or key attributes off a child attribute object (turned off). This option is ignored if Ignore Attribute is turned on.
Normalize: Set whether to trim whitespaces inside the text nodes (turned on) or not to trim them (turned off).
Normalize Tags: Set whether to normalize all tag names to lowercase (turned on) or keep tag names as-is (turned off).
Trim: Set whether to trim the whitespace at the beginning and end of text nodes (turned on) or to leave the whitespace as-is (turned off).

he very quick quickstart#
This quickstart gets you started using n8n as quickly as possible. Its allows you to try out the UI and introduces two key features: workflow templates and expressions. It doesn't include detailed explanations or explore concepts in-depth.
In this tutorial, you will:
Load a workflow from the workflow templates library
Add a node and configure it using expressions
Run your first workflow
Step one: Sign up for n8n#
This quickstart uses n8n Cloud. A free trial is available for new users. If you haven't already done so, sign up for an account now.
Step two: Open a workflow template#
n8n provides a quickstart template using training nodes. You can use this to work with fake data and avoid setting up credentials.
Go to Templates | Very quick quickstart.
Select Use workflow to view the options for using the template.
Select Import template to cloud workspace to load the template into your Cloud instance.
This workflow:
Gets example data from the Customer Datastore node.
Uses the Edit Fields node to extract only the desired data and assigns that data to variables. In this example, you map the customer name, ID, and description.
The individual pieces in an n8n workflow are called nodes. Double click a node to explore its settings and how it processes data.
Step three: Run the workflow#
Select Test Workflow. This runs the workflow, loading the data from the Customer Datastore node, then transforming it with Edit Fields. You need this data available in the workflow so that you can work with it in the next step.
Step four: Add a node#
Add a third node to message each customer and tell them their description. Use the Customer Messenger node to send a message to fake recipients.
Select the Add node  connector on the Edit Fields node.
Search for Customer Messenger. n8n shows a list of nodes that match the search.
Select Customer Messenger (n8n training) to add the node to the canvas. n8n opens the node automatically.
Use expressions to map in the Customer ID and create the Message:
In the INPUT panel select the Schema tab.
Drag Edit Fields1 > customer_id into the Customer ID field in the node settings.
Hover over Message. Select the Expression tab, then select the expand button  to open the full expressions editor.
Copy this expression into the editor:
1
Hi {{ $json.customer_name }}. Your description is: {{ $json.customer_description }}



Close the expressions editor, then close the Customer Messenger node by clicking outside the node or selecting Back to canvas.
Select Test Workflow. n8n runs the workflow.
The complete workflow should look like this:
Click to explore
View workflow file
Next steps#
Read n8n's longer try it out tutorial for a more complex workflow, and an introduction to more features and n8n concepts.
Take the text courses or video courses.
Your first workflow#
This guide will show you how to construct a workflow in n8n, explaining key concepts along the way. You will:
Create a workflow from scratch.
Understand key concepts and skills, including:
Starting workflows with trigger nodes
Configuring credentials
Processing data
Representing logic in an n8n workflow
Using expressions

This quickstart uses n8n Cloud, which is recommended for new users. A free trial is available - if you haven't already done so, sign up for an account now.
Step one: Create a new workflow#
When you open n8n, you'll see either:
A window with a welcome message and two large buttons: Choose Start from Scratch to create a new workflow.
The Workflows list on the Overview page. Select the Create Workflow to create a new workflow.
Step two: Add a trigger node#
n8n provides two ways to start a workflow:
Manually, by selecting Test Workflow.
Automatically, using a trigger node as the first node. The trigger node runs the workflow in response to an external event, or based on your settings.
For this tutorial, we'll use the Schedule trigger. This allows you to run the workflow on a schedule:
Select Add first step.
Search for Schedule. n8n shows a list of nodes that match the search.
Select Schedule Trigger to add the node to the canvas. n8n opens the node.
For Trigger Interval, select Weeks.
For Weeks Between Triggers, enter 1.
Enter a time and day. For this example, select Monday in Trigger on Weekdays, select 9am in Trigger at Hour, and enter 0 in Trigger at Minute.
Close the node details view to return to the canvas.
Step three: Add the NASA node and set up credentials#
The NASA node interacts with NASA's public APIs to fetch useful data. We will use the real-time data from the API to find solar events.
Credentials
Select the Add node  connector on the Schedule Trigger node.
Search for NASA. n8n shows a list of nodes that match the search.
Select NASA to view a list of operations.
Search for and select Get a DONKI solar flare. This operation returns a report about recent solar flares. When you select the operation, n8n adds the node to the canvas and opens it.
To access the NASA APIs, you need to set up credentials:
Select the Credential for NASA API dropdown.
Select Create new credential. n8n opens the credentials view.
Go to NASA APIs and fill out the form from the Generate API Key link. The NASA site generates the key and emails it to the address you entered.
Check your email account for the API key. Copy the key, and paste it into API Key in n8n.
Select Save.
Close the credentials screen. n8n returns to the node. The new credentials should be automatically selected in Credential for NASA API.
By default, DONKI Solar Flare provides data for the past 30 days. To limit it to just the last week, use Additional Fields:
Select Add field.
Select Start date.
To get a report starting from a week ago, you can use an expression: next to Start date, select the Expression tab, then select the expand button  to open the full expressions editor.
In the Expression field, enter the following expression:
1
{{ $today.minus(7, 'days') }}




This generates a date in the correct format, seven days before the current date.

Date and time formats in n8n...
Close the Edit Expression modal to return to the NASA node.
You can now check that the node is working and returning the expected date: select Execute step to run the node manually. n8n calls the NASA API and displays details of solar flares in the past seven days in the OUTPUT section.
Close the NASA node to return to the workflow canvas.
Step four: Add logic with the If node#
n8n supports complex logic in workflows. In this tutorial we will use the If node to create two branches that each generate a report from the NASA data. Solar flares have five possible classifications; we will add logic that sends a report with the lower classifications to one output, and the higher classifications to another.
Add the If node:
Select the Add node  connector on the NASA node.
Search for If. n8n shows a list of nodes that match the search.
Select If to add the node to the canvas. n8n opens the node.
You need to check the value of the classType property in the NASA data. To do this:
Drag classType into Value 1.
Make sure you ran the NASA node in the previous section
If you didn't follow the step in the previous section to run the NASA node, you won't see any data to work with in this step.
Change the comparison operation to String > Contains.
In Value 2, enter X. This is the highest classification of solar flare. In the next step, you will create two reports: one for X class solar flares, and one for all the smaller solar flares.
You can now check that the node is working and returning the expected date: select Execute step to run the node manually. n8n tests the data against the condition, and shows which results match true or false in the OUTPUT panel.
Weeks without large solar flares
In this tutorial, you are working with live data. If you find there aren't any X class solar flares when you run the workflow, try replacing X in Value 2 with either A, B, C, or M.
Once you are happy the node will return some events, you can close the node to return to the canvas.
Step five: Output data from your workflow#
The last step of the workflow is to send the two reports about solar flares. For this example, you'll send data to Postbin. Postbin is a service that receives data and displays it on a temporary web page.
On the If node, select the Add node  connector labeled true.
Search for PostBin. n8n shows a list of nodes that match the search.
Select PostBin.
Select Send a request. n8n adds the node to the canvas and opens it.
Go to Postbin and select Create Bin. Leave the tab open so you can come back to it when testing the workflow.
Copy the bin ID. It looks similar to 1651063625300-2016451240051.
In n8n, paste your Postbin ID into Bin ID.
Now, configure the data to send to Postbin. Next to Bin Content, select the Expression tab (you will need to mouse-over the Bin Content for the tab to appear), then select the expand button  to open the full expressions editor.
You can now click and drag the correct field from the If Node output into the expressions editor to automatically create a reference for this label. In this case the input we want is 'classType'.
Once dropped into the expressions editor it will transform into this reference: {{$json["classType"]}}. Add a message to it, so that the full expression is:
1
There was a solar flare of class {{$json["classType"]}}





Close the expressions editor to return to the node.
Close the Postbin node to return to the canvas.
Add another Postbin node, to handle the false output path from the If node:
Hover over the Postbin node, then select Node context menu  > Duplicate node to duplicate the first Postbin node.
Drag the false connector from the If node to the left side of the new Postbin node.
Step six: Test the workflow#
You can now test the entire workflow. Select Test Workflow. n8n runs the workflow, showing each stage in progress.
Go back to your Postbin bin. Refresh the page to see the output.
If you want to use this workflow (in other words, if you want it to run once a week automatically), you need to activate it by selecting the Active toggle.
Time limit
Postbin's bins exist for 30 minutes after creation. You may need to create a new bin and update the ID in the Postbin nodes, if you exceed this time limit.
Congratulations#
You now have a fully functioning workflow that does something useful! It should look something like this:

Along the way you have discovered:
How to find the nodes you want and join them together
How to use expressions to manipulate data
How to create credentials and attach them to nodes
How to use logic in your workflows
There are plenty of things you could add to this (perhaps add some more credentials and a node to send you an email of the results), or maybe you have a specific project in mind. Whatever your next steps, the resources linked below should help.

Navigating the Editor UI#
In this lesson you will learn how to navigate the Editor UI. We will walk through the canvas and show you what each icon means and where to find things you will need while building workflows in n8n.
n8n version
This course is based on n8n version 1.82.1. In other versions, some user interfaces might look different, but this shouldn't impact the core functionality.
Getting started#
Begin by setting up n8n.
We recommend starting with n8n Cloud, a hosted solution that doesn't require installation and includes a free trial.
Alternative set up
If n8n Cloud isn't a good option for you, you can self-host with Docker. This is an advanced option recommended only for technical users familiar with hosting services, Docker, and the command line.
For more details on the different ways to set up n8n, see our platforms documentation.
Once you have n8n running, open the Editor UI in a browser window. Log in to your n8n instance. Select Overview and then Create Workflow to view the main canvas.
It should look like this:
Editor UI
Editor UI settings#
The editor UI is the web interface where you build workflows. You can access all your workflows and credentials, as well as support pages, from the Editor UI.
Left-side panel#
On the left side of the Editor UI, there is a panel which contains the core functionalities and settings for managing your workflows. Expand and collapse it by selecting the small arrow icon.
The panel contains the following sections:
Overview: Contains all the workflows and credentials you have access to. During this course, create new workflows here.
Projects: (Not available on Community edition) Projects group workflows and credentials. You can assign roles to users in a project to control what they can do in a project. A Personal project is available by default.
Admin Panel: n8n Cloud only. Access your n8n instance usage, billing, and version settings.
Templates: A collection of pre-made workflows. Great place to get started with common use cases.
Variables: Used to store and access fixed data across your workflows. This feature is available on the Pro and Enterprise Plans.
All executions: Contains information about your workflow executions.
Help: Contains resources around n8n product and community.
Update: (When updates are available) Indicator for any recent product updates.
Settings: Under the ellipsis (...) menu by your username. Manage users and access settings for a variety of features.
Editor UI left-side menu
Top bar#
The top bar of the Editor UI contains the following information:
Workflow Name: By default, n8n names a new workflow as "My workflow", but you can edit the name at any time.
+ Add Tag: Tags help you organise your workflows by category, use case, or whatever is relevant for you. Tags are optional.
Inactive/active toggle: This button activates or deactivates the current workflow. By default, workflows are deactivated.
Share: You can share and collaborate with others on workflows on the Starter, Pro, and Enterprise plans.
Save: This button saves the current workflow.
History: Once you save your workflow, you can view previous versions here.
Editor UI top bar
Canvas#
The canvas is the gray dotted grid background in the Editor UI. It displays several icons and a node with different functionalities:
Buttons to zoom the canvas to fit the screen, zoom in or out of the canvas, and tidy up the nodes on screen.
A button to Execute workflow once you add your first node. When you click on it, n8n executes all nodes on the canvas in sequence.
A button with a + sign inside. This button opens the nodes panel.
A button with a note icon inside. This button adds a sticky note to the canvas (visible when hovering on the top right + icon).
A dotted square with the text "Add first step." This is where you add your first node.
Workflow canvas
Moving the canvas
You can move the workflow canvas around in three ways:
Select Ctrl+Left Button on the canvas and move it around.
Select Middle Button on the canvas and move it around.
Place two fingers on your touchpad and slide.
Don't worry about workflow execution and activation for now; we'll explain these concepts later on in the course.
Nodes#
You can think of nodes as building blocks that serve different functions that, when put together, make up a functioning machine: an automated workflow.
Node
A node is an individual step in your workflow: one that either (a) loads, (b) processes, or (c) sends data.
Based on their function, n8n classifies nodes into four types:
App or Action Nodes add, remove, and edit data; request and send external data; and trigger events in other systems. Refer to the Action nodes library for a full list of these nodes.
Trigger Nodes start a workflow and supply the initial data. Refer to the Trigger nodes library for a list of trigger nodes.
Core Nodes can be trigger or app nodes. Whereas most nodes connect to a specific external service, core nodes provide functionality such as logic, scheduling, or generic API calls. Refer to the Core Nodes library for a full list of core nodes.
Cluster Nodes are node groups that work together to provide functionality in a workflow, primarily for AI workflows. Refer to Cluster nodes for more information.
Learn more
Refer to Node types for a more detailed explanation of all node types.
Finding nodes#
You can find all available nodes in the nodes panel on the right side of the Editor UI. There are three ways in which you can open the nodes panel:
Click the + icon in the top right corner of the canvas.
Click the + icon on the right side of an existing node on the canvas (the node to which you want to add another one).
Click the Tab key on your keyboard.
Building a Mini-workflow#
In this lesson, you will build a small workflow that gets 10 articles about automation from Hacker News. The process consists of five steps:
Add a Manual Trigger node
Add the Hacker News node
Configure the Hacker News node
Execute the node
Save the workflow
The finished workflow will look like this:
Click to explore
View workflow file
1. Add a Manual Trigger node#
Open the nodes panel (reminder: you can open this by selecting the + icon in the top right corner of the canvas or selecting Tab on your keyboard).
Then:
Search for the Manual Trigger node.
Select it when it appears in the search.
This will add the Manual Trigger node to your canvas, which allows you to run the workflow at any time by selecting the Execute workflow button.
Manual triggers
For faster workflow creation, you can skip this step in the future. Adding any other node without a trigger will add the Manual Trigger node to the workflow.
In a real-world scenario, you would probably want to set up a schedule or some other trigger to run the workflow.
2. Add the Hacker News node#
Select the + icon to the right of the Manual Trigger node to open the nodes panel.
Then:
Search for the Hacker News node.
Select it when it appears in the search.
In the Actions section, select Get many items.
n8n adds the node to your canvas and the node window opens to display its configuration details.
3. Configure the Hacker News node#
When you add a new node to the Editor UI, the node is automatically activated. The node details will open in a window with several options:
Parameters: Adjust parameters to refine and control the node's functionality.
Settings: Adjust settings to control the node's design and executions.
Docs: Open the n8n documentation for this node in a new window.
Parameters vs. Settings
Parameters are different for each node, depending on its functionality.
Settings are the same for all nodes.
Parameters#
We need to configure several parameters for the Hacker News node to make it work:
Resource: All
This resource selects all data records (articles).
Operation: Get Many
This operation fetches all the selected articles.
Limit: 10
This parameter sets a limit to the number of results the Get Many operation returns.
Additional Fields > Add Field > Keyword: automation
Additional fields are options that you can add to certain nodes to make your request more specific or filter the results. For this example, we want to get only articles that include the keyword "automation."
The configuration of the parameters for the Hacker News node should now look like this:
Hacker News node parameters
Settings#
The Settings section includes several options for node design and executions. In this case, we'll configure only the final two settings, which set the node's appearance in the Editor UI canvas.
In the Hacker News node Settings, edit:
Notes: Get the 10 latest articles.
Node notes
It's often helpful to add a short description in the node about what it does. This is helpful for complex or shared workflows in particular!
Display note in flow?: toggle to true
This option will display the Note under the node in the canvas.
The configuration of the settings for the Hacker News node should now look like this:
Hacker News node settings
Renaming a node
You can rename the node with a name that's more descriptive for your use case. There are three ways to do this:
Select the node you want to rename and at the same time press the F2 key on your keyboard.
Double-click on the node to open the node window. Click on the name of the node in the top left corner of the window, rename it as you like, then click Rename to save the node under the new name.
Right-click on the node and select the Rename option.
Renaming a node from the keyboard
To find the original node name (the type of node), open the node window and select Settings. The bottom of the page contains the node type and version.
4. Execute the node#
Select the Execute step button in the node details window. You should see 10 results in the Output Table view.
Results in Table view for the Hacker News node
Node executions#
Node execution
A node execution represents a run of that node to retrieve or process the specified data.
If a node executes successfully, a small green checkmark appears on top of the node in the canvas
Successfully executed workflow
If there are no problems with the parameters and everything works fine, the requested data displays in the node window in Table, JSON, and Schema format. You can switch between these views by selecting the one you want from the Table | JSON | Schema button at the top of the node window.
Table vs JSON views
The Table view is the default. It displays the requested data in a table, where the rows are the records and the columns are the available attributes of those records.
Here's our Hacker News output in JSON view:
Results in JSON view for the Hacker News node
The node window displays more information about the node execution:
Next to the Output title, notice a small icon (this will be a green checkmark if the node execution succeeded). Beside it, there is an info icon. If you hover on it, you'll get two more pieces of information that can provide insights into the performance of each individual node in a workflow:
Start Time: When the node execution started.
Execution Time: How long it took for the node to return the results from the moment it started executing.
Just below the Output title, you'll notice another piece of information: 10 items. This field displays the number of items (records) that the node request returned. In this example, it's expected to be 10, since this is the limit we set in step 2. But if you don't set a limit, it's useful to see how many records are actually returned.
Error in nodes
A red warning icon on a node means that the node has errors. This might happen if the node credentials are missing or incorrect or the node parameters aren't configured correctly.
Error in nodes
5. Save the workflow#
Once you're finished editing the node, select Back to canvas to return to the main canvas.
By default, your workflow is automatically saved as "My workflow."
For this lesson, rename the workflow to be "Hacker News workflow."
Reminder
You can rename a workflow by clicking on the workflow's name at the top of the Editor UI.
Once you've renamed the workflow, be sure to save it.
There are two ways in which you can save a workflow:
From the Canvas in Editor UI, click Ctrl + S or Cmd + S on your keyboard.
Select the Save button in the top right corner of the Editor UI. You may need to leave the node editor first by clicking outside the dialog.
If you see a grey Saved text instead of the Save button, your workflow was automatically saved.
Summary#
Congratulations, you just built your first workflow! In this lesson, you learned how to use actions in app nodes, configure their parameters and settings, and save and execute your workflow.
In the next lesson, you'll meet your new client, Nathan, who needs to automate his sales reporting work. You will build a more complex workflow for his use case, helping him become more productive at work.


Nodes panel
In the nodes panel, notice that when adding your first node, you will see the different trigger node categories. After you have added your trigger node, you'll see that the nodes panel changes to show Advanced AI, Actions in an App, Data transformation, Flow, Core, and Human in the loop nodes.
If you want to find a specific node, use the search input at the top of the nodes panel.
Adding nodes#
There are two ways to add nodes to your canvas:
Select the node you want in the nodes panel. The new node will automatically connect to the selected node on the canvas.
Drag and drop the node from the nodes panel to the canvas.
Node buttons#
If you hover on a node, you'll notice that three icons appear on top:
Execute the node (Play icon)
Deactivate/Activate the node (Power icon)
Delete the node (Trash icon)
There will also be an ellipsis icon, which opens a context menu containing other node options.
Moving a workflow
To move a workflow around the canvas, select all nodes with your mouse or Ctrl+A, select and hold on a node, then drag it to any point you want on the canvas.
Summary#
In this lesson you learned how to navigate the Editor UI, what the icons mean, how to access the left-side and node panels, and how to add nodes to the canvas.
In the next lesson, you will build a mini-workflow to put into practice what you've learned so far.
Automating a (Real-world) Use Case#
Meet Nathan 🙋. Nathan works as an Analytics Manager at ABCorp. His job is to support the ABCorp team with reporting and analytics. Being a true jack of all trades, he also handles several miscellaneous initiatives.
Some things that Nathan does are repetitive and mind-numbing. He wants to automate some of these tasks so that he doesn't burn out. As an Automation Expert, you are meeting with Nathan today to help him understand how he can offload some of his responsibilities to n8n.
Understanding the scenario#
You 👩‍🔧: Nice to meet you, Nathan. Glad to be doing this! What's a repetitive task that's error-prone and that you'd like to get off your plate first?
Nathan 🙋: Thanks for coming in! The most annoying one's gotta be the weekly sales reporting.
I have to collect sales data from our legacy data warehouse, which manages data from the main business processes of an organization, such as sales or production. Now, each sales order can have the status Processing or Booked. I have to calculate the sum of all the Booked orders and announce them in the company Discord every Monday. Then I have to create a spreadsheet of all the Processing sales so that the Sales Managers can review them and check if they need to follow up with customers.
This manual work is tough and requires high attention to detail to make sure that all the numbers are right. Inevitably, I lose my focus and mistype a number or I don't get it done on time. I've been criticized once by my manager for miscalculating the data.
You 👩‍🔧: Oh no! Doesn't the data warehouse have a way to export the data?
Nathan 🙋: The data warehouse was written in-house ages ago. It doesn't have a CSV export but they recently added a couple of API endpoints that expose this data, if that helps.
You 👩‍🔧: Perfect! That's a good start. If you have a generic API, we can add some custom code and a couple of services to make an automated workflow. This gig has n8n written all over it. Let's get started!
Designing the Workflow#
Now that we know what Nathan wants to automate, let's consider the steps he needs to take to achieve his goals:
Get the relevant data (order id, order status, order value, employee name) from the data warehouse
Filter the orders by their status (Processing or Booked)
Calculate the total value of all the Booked orders
Notify the team members about the Booked orders in the company's Discord channel
Insert the details about the Processing orders in Airtable for follow-up
Schedule this workflow to run every Monday morning
Nathan's workflow involves sending data from the company's data warehouse to two external services:
Discord
Airtable
Before that, the data has to be wrangled with general functions (conditional filtering, calculation, scheduling).
n8n provides integrations for all these steps, so Nathan's workflow in n8n would look like this:
Click to explore
View workflow file
You will build this workflow in eight steps:
Getting data from the data warehouse
Inserting data into Airtable
Filtering orders
Setting values for processing orders
Calculating booked orders
Notifying the team
Scheduling the workflow
Activating and examining the workflow
To build this workflow, you will need the credentials found in the email you received from n8n when you signed up for this course. If you haven't signed up already, you can do it here. If you haven't received a confirmation email after signing up, contact us.
. Getting data from the data warehouse#
In this part of the workflow, you will learn how to get data by making HTTP requests with the HTTP Request node.
After completing this section, your workflow will look like this:
Click to explore
View workflow file
First, let's set the scene for building Nathan's workflow.
Create new workflow#
Open your Editor UI and create a new workflow with one of the two possible commands:
Select Ctrl+Alt+N or Cmd+Option+N on your keyboard.
Open the left menu, navigate to Workflows, and select Add workflow.
Name this new workflow "Nathan's workflow."
The first thing you need to do is get data from ABCorp's old data warehouse.
In a previous chapter, you used an action node designed for a specific service (Hacker News). But not all apps or services have dedicated nodes, like the legacy data warehouse from Nathan's company.
Though we can't directly export the data, Nathan told us that the data warehouse has a couple of API endpoints. That's all we need to access the data using the HTTP Request node in n8n.
No node for that service?
The HTTP Request node is one of the most versatile nodes, allowing you to make HTTP requests to query data from apps and services. You can use it to access data from apps or services that don't have a dedicated node in n8n.
Add an HTTP Request node#
Now, in your Editor UI, add an HTTP Request node like you learned in the lesson Adding nodes. The node window will open, where you need to configure some parameters.
HTTP Request node
This node will use credentials.
Credentials
Credentials are unique pieces of information that identify a user or a service and allow them to access apps or services (in our case, represented as n8n nodes). A common form of credentials is a username and a password, but they can take other forms depending on the service.
In this case, you'll need the credentials for the ABCorp data warehouse API included in the email from n8n you received when you signed up for this course. If you haven't signed up yet, sign up here.
In the Parameters of the HTTP Request node, make the following adjustments:
Method: This should default to GET. Make sure it's set to GET.
URL: Add the Dataset URL you received in the email when you signed up for this course.
Send Headers: Toggle this control to true. In Specify Headers, ensure Using Fields Below is selected.
Header Parameters > Name: Enter unique_id.
Header Parameters > Value: The Unique ID you received in the email when you signed up for this course.
Authentication: Select Generic Credential Type. This option requires credentials before allowing you to access the data.
Generic Auth Type: Select Header Auth. (This field will appear after you select the Generic Credential Type for the Authentication.)
Credential for Header Auth: To add your credentials, select + Create new credential. This will open the Credentials window.
In the Credentials window, set Name to be the Header Auth name you received in the email when you signed up for this course.
In the Credentials window, set Value to be the Header Auth value you received in the email when you signed up for this course.
Select the Save button in the Credentials window to save your credentials. Your Credentials Connection window should look like this:
HTTP Request node credentials
Credentials naming
New credential names follow the " account" format by default. You can rename the credentials by clicking on the name, similarly to renaming nodes. It's good practice to give them names that identify the app/service, type, and purpose of the credential. A naming convention makes it easier to keep track of and identify your credentials.
Once you save, exit out of the Credentials window to return to the HTTP Request node.
Get the data#
Select the Execute step button in the HTTP Request node window. The table view of the HTTP request results should look like this:
HTTP Request node output
This view should be familiar to you from the Building a mini-workflow page.
This is the data from ABCorp's data warehouse that Nathan needs to work with. This data set includes sales information from 30 customers with five columns:
orderID: The unique id of each order.
customerID: The unique id of each customer.
employeeName: The name of Nathan's colleague responsible for the customer.
orderPrice: The total price of the customer's order.
orderStatus: Whether the customer's order status is booked or still in processing.
What's next?#
Nathan 🙋: This is great! You already automated an important part of my job with only one node. Now instead of manually accessing the data every time I need it, I can use the HTTP Request Node to automatically get the information.
You 👩‍🔧: Exactly! In the next step, I'll help you one step further and insert the data you retrieved into Airtable.
2. Inserting data into Airtable#
In this step of the workflow, you will learn how to insert the data received from the HTTP Request node into Airtable using the Airtable node.
Spreadsheet nodes
You can replace the Airtable node with another spreadsheet app/service. For example, n8n also has a node for Google Sheets.
After this step, your workflow should look like this:
Click to explore
View workflow file
Configure your table#
If we're going to insert data into Airtable, we first need to set up a table there. To do this:
Create an Airtable account.
In your Airtable workspace add a new base from scratch and name it, for example, beginner course.
Create an Airtable base
In the beginner course base, by default, you have a table called Table 1 with four fields: Name, Notes, Assignee, and Status. These fields aren't relevant for us since they aren't in our "orders" data set. This brings us to the next point: the names of the fields in Airtable have to match the names of the columns in the node result. Prepare the table by doing the following:
Rename the table from Table 1 to orders to make it easier to identify.
Delete the 3 blank records created by default.
Delete the Notes, Assignee, and Status fields.
Edit the Name field (the primary field) to read orderID, with the Number field type.
Add the rest of the fields, and their field types, using the table below as a reference:


Field name
Field type
orderID
Number
customerID
Number
employeeName
Single line text
orderPrice
Number
orderStatus
Single line text

Now your table should look like this:
Orders table in Airtable
Now that the table is ready, let's return to the workflow in the n8n Editor UI.
Add an Airtable node to the HTTP Request node#
Add an Airtable node connected to the HTTP Request node.
Remember
You can add a node connected to an existing node by selecting the + icon next to the existing node.
In the node panel:
Search for Airtable.
Select Create a record from the Record Actions search results.
This will add the Airtable node to your canvas and open the node details window.
In the Airtable node window, configure the following parameters:
Credential to connect with:
Select Create new credential.
Keep the default option Connect using: Access Token selected.
Access token: Follow the instructions from the Airtable credential page to create your token. Use the recommended scopes and add access to your beginners course base. Save the credential and close the Credential window when you're finished.
Resource: Record.
Operation: Create. This operation will create new records in the table.
Base: You can pick your base from a list (for example, beginner course).
Table: orders.
Mapping Column Mode: Map automatically. In this mode, the incoming data fields must have the same as the columns in Airtable.
Test the Airtable node#
Once you've finished configuring the Airtable node, execute it by selecting Execute step. This might take a moment to process, but you can follow the progress by viewing the base in Airtable.
Your results should look like this:
Airtable node results
All 30 data records will now appear in the orders table in Airtable:
Imported records in the orders table
What's next?#
Nathan 🙋: Wow, this automation is already so useful! But this inserts all collected data from the HTTP Request node into Airtable. Remember that I actually need to insert only processing orders in the table and calculate the price of booked orders?
You 👩‍🔧: Sure, no problem. As a next step, I'll use a new node to filter the orders based on their status.
In this step of the workflow, you will learn how to filter data using conditional logic and how to use expressions in nodes using the If node.
After this step, your workflow should look like this:
Click to explore
View workflow file
To insert only processing orders into Airtable we need to filter our data by orderStatus. Basically, we want to tell the program that if the orderStatus is processing, then insert all records with this status into Airtable; else, for example, if the orderStatus isn't processing, calculate the sum of all orders with the other orderStatus (booked).
This if-then-else command is conditional logic. In n8n workflows, you can add conditional logic with the If node, which splits a workflow conditionally based on comparison operations.
If vs. Switch
If you need to filter data on more than boolean values (true and false), use the Switch node. The Switch node is similar to the If node, but supports multiple output connectors.
Add If node before the Airtable node#
First, let's add an If node between the connection from the HTTP Request node to the Airtable node:
Hover over the arrow connection the HTTP Request node and the Airtable node.
Select the + sign between the HTTP Request node and the Airtable node.
Configure the If node#
Selecting the plus removes the connection to the Airtable node to the HTTP request. Now, let's add an If node connected to the HTTP Request node:
Search for the If node.
Select it when it appears in the search.
For the If node, we'll use an expression.
Expressions
An expression is a string of characters and symbols in a programming language that can be evaluated to get a value, often according to its input. In n8n workflows, you can use expressions in a node to refer to another node for input data. In our example, the If node references the data output by the HTTP Request node.
In the If node window, configure the parameters:
Set the value1 placeholder to {{ $json.orderStatus }} with the following steps:
Hover over the value1 field.
Select the Expression tab on the right side of the value1 field.
Next, open the expression editor by selecting the link icon:
Opening the Expression Editor
Use the left-side panel to select HTTP Request > orderStatus and drag it into the Expression field in the center of the window.
Expression Editor in the If node
Once you add the expression, close the Edit Expression dialog.
Operation: Select String > is equal to
Set the value2 placeholder to processing.
Data Type
Make sure to select the correct data type (boolean, date & time, number, or string) when you select the Operation.
Select Execute step to test the If node.
Your results should look like this:
If node output
Note that the orders with a processing order status should show for the True Branch output, while the orders with a booked order status should show in the False Branch output.
Close the If node detail view when you're finished.
Insert data into Airtable#
Next, we want to insert this data into Airtable. Remember what Nathan said at the end of the Inserting data into Airtable lesson?
I actually need to insert only processing orders in the table...
Since Nathan only needs the processing orders in the table, we'll connect the Airtable node to the If node's true connector.
In this case, since the Airtable node is already on our canvas, select the If node true connector and drag it to the Airtable node.
It's a good idea at this point to retest the Airtable node. Before you do, open your table in Airtable and delete all existing rows. Then open the Airtable node window in n8n and select Execute step.
Review your data in Airtable to be sure your workflow only added the correct orders (those with orderStatus of processing). There should be 14 records now instead of 30.
At this stage, your workflow should look like this:
Click to explore
View workflow file
What's next?#
Nathan 🙋: This If node is so useful for filtering data! Now I have all the information about processing orders. I actually only need the employeeName and orderID, but I guess I can keep all the other fields just in case.
You 👩‍🔧: Actually, I wouldn't recommend doing that. Inserting more data requires more computational power, the data transfer is slower and takes longer, and takes up more storage resources in your table. In this particular case, 14 records with 5 fields might not seem like it'd make a significant difference, but if your business grows to thousands of records and dozens of fields, things add up and even one extra column can affect performance.
Nathan 🙋: Oh, that's good to know. Can you select only two fields from the processing orders?
You 👩‍🔧: Sure, I'll do that in the next step.
4. Setting Values for Processing Orders#
In this step of the workflow, you will learn how to select and set data before transferring it to Airtable using the Edit Fields (Set) node. After this step, your workflow should look like this:
Click to explore
View workflow file
The next step in Nathan's workflow is to filter the data to only insert the employeeName and orderID of all processing orders into Airtable.
For this, you need to use the Edit Fields (Set) node, which allows you to select and set the data you want to transfer from one node to another.
Edit Fields node
The Edit Fields node can set completely new data as well as overwrite data that already exists. This node is crucial in workflows which expect incoming data from previous nodes, such as when inserting values into spreadsheets or databases.
Add another node before the Airtable node#
In your workflow, add another node before the Airtable node from the If node in the same way we did it in the Filtering Orders lesson on the If node's true connector. Feel free to drag the Airtable node further away if your canvas feels crowded.
Configure the Edit Fields node#
Now search for the Edit Fields (Set) node after you've selected the + sign coming off the If node's true connector.
With the Edit Fields node window open, configure these parameters:
Ensure Mode is set to Manual Mapping.
While you can use the Expression editor we used in the Filtering Orders lesson, this time, let's drag the fields from the Input into the Fields to Set:
Drag If > orderID as the first field.
Drag If > employeeName as the second field.
Ensure that Include Other Input Fields is set to false.
Select Execute step. You should see the following results:
Edit Fields (Set) node
Add data to Airtable#
Next, let's insert these values into Airtable:
Go to your Airtable base.
Add a new table called processingOrders.
Replace the existing columns with two new columns:
orderID (primary field): Number
employeeName: Single line text
Reminder
If you get stuck, refer to the Inserting data into Airtable lesson.
Delete the three empty rows in the new table.
In n8n, connect the Edit Fields node connector to the Airtable node**.
Update the Airtable node configuration to point to the new processingOrders table instead of the orders table.
Test your Airtable node to be sure it inserts records into the new processingOrders table.
At this stage, your workflow should now look like this:
Click to explore
View workflow file
What's next?#
Nathan 🙋: You've already automated half of my work! Now I still need to calculate the booked orders for my colleagues. Can we automate that as well?
You 👩‍🔧: Yes! In the next step, I'll use some JavaScript code in a node to calculate the booked orders.
5. Calculating Booked Orders#
In this step of the workflow you will learn how n8n structures data and how to add custom JavaScript code to perform calculations using the Code node. After this step, your workflow should look like this:
Click to explore
View workflow file
The next step in Nathan's workflow is to calculate two values from the booked orders:
The total number of booked orders
The total value of all booked orders
To calculate data and add more functionality to your workflows you can use the Code node, which lets you write custom JavaScript code.
About the Code node#
Code node modes
The Code node has two operational modes, depending on how you want to process items:
Run Once for All Items allows you to write code to process all input items at once, as a group.
Run Once for Each Item executes your code once for each input item.
Learn more about how to use the Code node.
In n8n, the data that's passed between nodes is an array of objects with the following JSON structure:
1

   		 }
   	 },
   	 "binary": { 
   		 "apple-picture": { 
   			 "data": "....", 
   			 "mimeType": "image/png", 
   			 "fileExtension": "png", 
   			 "fileName": "example.png", 
   		 }
   	 }
    },
    ...
]



You can learn more about the expected format on the n8n data structure page.
Configure the Code node#
Now let's see how to accomplish Nathan's task using the Code node.
In your workflow, add a Code node connected to the false branch of the If node.
With the Code node window open, configure these parameters:
Mode: Select Run Once for All Items.
Language: Select JavaScript.
Using Python in code nodes
While we use JavaScript below, you can also use Python in the Code node. To learn more, refer to the Code node documentation.
Copy the Code below and paste it into the Code box to replace the existing code:
1

let items = $input.all();
let totalBooked = items.length;
let bookedSum = 0;

for (let i=0; i < items.length; i++) {
  bookedSum = bookedSum + items[i].json.orderPrice;
}

return [{ json: {totalBooked, bookedSum} }];



Notice the format in which we return the results of the calculation:
1
return [{ json: {totalBooked, bookedSum} }]



Data structure error
If you don't use the correct data structure, you will get an error message: Error: Always an Array of items has to be returned!
Now select Execute step and you should see the following results:
Code node output
What's next?#
Nathan 🙋: Wow, the Code node is powerful! This means that if I have some basic JavaScript skills I can power up my workflows.
You 👩‍🔧: Yes! You can progress from no-code to low-code!
Nathan 🙋: Now, how do I send the calculations for the booked orders to my team's Discord channel?
You 👩‍🔧: There's an n8n node for that. I'll set it up in the next step.
6. Notifying the Team#
In this step of the workflow, you will learn how to send messages to a Discord channel using the Discord node. After this step, your workflow should look like this:
Click to explore
View workflow file
Now that you have a calculated summary of the booked orders, you need to notify Nathan's team in their Discord channel. For this workflow, you will send messages to the n8n server on Discord.
Before you begin the steps below, use the link above to connect to the n8n server on Discord. Be sure you can access the #course-level-1 channel.

You can replace the Discord node with another communication app. For example, n8n also has nodes for Slack and Mattermost.
In your workflow, add a Discord node connected to the Code node.
When you search for the Discord node, look for Message Actions and select Send a message to add the node.
In the Discord node window, configure these parameters:
Connection Type: Select Webhook.
Credential for Discord Webhook: Select - Create New Credential -.
Copy the Webhook URL from the email you received when you signed up for this course and paste it into the Webhook URL field of the credentials.
Select Save and then close the credentials dialog.
Operation: Select Send a Message.
Message:
Select the Expression tab on the right side of the Message field.
Copy the text below and paste it into the Expression window, or construct it manually using the Expression Editor.
1
This week we've {{$json["totalBooked"]}} booked orders with a total value of {{$json["bookedSum"]}}. My Unique ID: {{ $('HTTP Request').params["headerParameters"]["parameters"][0]["value"] }}



Now select Execute step in the Discord node. If all works well, you should see this output in n8n:
Discord node output
And your message should appear in the Discord channel #course-level-1:

What's next?#
Nathan 🙋: Incredible, you've saved me hours of tedious work already! Now I can execute this workflow when I need it. I just need to remember to run it every Monday morning at 9 AM.
You 👩‍🔧: Don't worry about that, you can actually schedule the workflow to run on a specific day, time, or interval. I'll set this up in the next step.
7. Scheduling the Workflow#
In this step of the workflow, you will learn how to schedule your workflow so that it runs automatically at a set time/interval using the Schedule Trigger node. After this step, your workflow should look like this:
Click to explore
View workflow file
The workflow you've built so far executes only when you click on Test Workflow. But Nathan needs it to run automatically every Monday morning. You can do this with the Schedule Trigger, which allows you to schedule workflows to run periodically at fixed dates, times, or intervals.
To achieve this, we'll remove the Manual Trigger node we started with and replace it with a Schedule Trigger node instead.
Remove the Manual Trigger node#
First, let's remove the Manual Trigger node:
Select the Manual Trigger node connected to your HTTP Request node.
Select the trash can icon to delete.
This removes the Manual Trigger node and you'll see an "Add first step" option.
Add the Schedule Trigger node#
Open the nodes panel and search for Schedule Trigger.
Select it when it appears in the search results.
In the Schedule Trigger node window, configure these parameters:
Trigger Interval: Select Weeks.
Weeks Between Triggers: Enter 1.
Trigger on weekdays: Select Monday (and remove Sunday if added by default).
Trigger at Hour: Select 9am.
Trigger at Minute: Enter 0.
Your Schedule Trigger node should look like this:
Schedule Trigger Node
Keep in mind
To ensure accurate scheduling with the Schedule Trigger node, be sure to set the correct timezone for your n8n instance or the workflow's settings. The Schedule Trigger node will use the workflow's timezone if it's set; it will fall back to the n8n instance's timezone if it's not.
Connect the Schedule Trigger node#
Return to the canvas and connect your Schedule Trigger node to the HTTP Request node by dragging the arrow from it to the HTTP Request node.
Your full workflow should look like this:
Click to explore
View workflow file
What's next?#
You 👩‍🔧: That was it for the workflow! I've added and configured all necessary nodes. Now every time you click on Execute workflow, n8n will execute all the nodes: getting, filtering, calculating, and transferring the sales data.
Nathan 🙋: This is just what I needed! My workflow will run automatically every Monday morning, correct?
You 👩‍🔧: Not so fast. To do that, you need to activate your workflow. I'll do this in the next step and show you how to interpret the execution log.
8. Activating and Examining the Workflow#
In this step of the workflow, you will learn how to activate your workflow and change the default workflow settings.
Activating a workflow means that it will run automatically every time a trigger node receives input or meets a condition. By default, all newly created workflows start deactivated.
To activate your workflow, set the Inactive toggle in the top navigation of the Editor UI to be Activated. Nathan's workflow will now be executed automatically every Monday at 9 AM:
Activated workflow
Workflow Executions#
An execution represents a completed run of a workflow, from the first to the last node. n8n logs workflow executions, allowing you to see if the workflow succeeded or not. The execution log is useful for debugging your workflow and seeing at what stage it runs into issues.
To view the executions for a specific workflow, you can switch to the Executions tab when the workflow is open on the canvas. Use the Editor tab to swap back to the node editor.
To see the execution log for the entire n8n instance, in your Editor UI, select Overview and then select the Executions tab in the main panel.
Execution List
The Executions window displays a table with the following information:
Name: The name of the workflow
Started At: The date and time when the workflow started
Status: The status of the workflow (Waiting, Running, Succeeded, Cancelled, or Failed) and the amount of time it took the workflow to execute
Execution ID: The ID of this workflow execution
Workflow execution status
You can filter the displayed Executions by workflow and by status (Any Status, Failed, Cancelled, Running, Success, or Waiting). The information displayed here depends on which executions you configure to save in the Workflow Settings.
Workflow Settings#
You can customize your workflows and executions, or overwrite some global default settings in Workflow Settings.
Access these settings by selecting the three dots in the upper right corner of the Editor UI when the workflow is open on the canvas, then select Settings.
Workflow Settings
In the Workflow Settings window you can configure the following settings:
Execution Order: Choose the execution logic for multi-branch workflows. You should leave this set to v1 if you don't have workflows that rely on the legacy execution ordering.
Error Workflow: A workflow to run if the execution of the current workflow fails.
This workflow can be called by: Workflows allowed to call this workflow using the Execute Sub-workflow node.
Timezone: The timezone to use in the current workflow. If not set, the global timezone. In particular, this setting is important for the Schedule Trigger node, as you want to make sure that the workflow gets executed at the right time.
Save failed production executions: If n8n should save the Execution data of the workflow when it fails. Default is to save.
Save successful production executions: If n8n should save the Execution data of the workflow when it succeeds. Default is to save.
Save manual executions: If n8n should save executions started from the Editor UI. Default is to save.
Save execution progress: If n8n should save the execution data of each node. If set to Save, you can resume the workflow from where it stopped in case of an error, though keep in mind that this might make the execution slower. Default is to not save.
Timeout Workflow: Whether to cancel a workflow execution after a specific period of time. Default is to not timeout.
What's next?#
You 👩‍🔧: That was it! Now you have a 7-node workflow that will run automatically every Monday morning. You don't have to worry about remembering to wrangle the data. Instead, you can start your week with more meaningful or exciting work.
Nathan 🙋: This workflow is incredibly helpful, thank you! Now, what's next for you?
You 👩‍🔧: I'd like to build more workflows, share them with others, and use some workflows built by other people.
Exporting and importing workflows#
In this chapter, you will learn how to export and import workflows.
Exporting and importing workflows#
You can save n8n workflows locally as JSON files. This is useful if you want to share your workflow with someone else or import a workflow from someone else.
Sharing credentials
Exported workflow JSON files include credential names and IDs. While IDs aren't sensitive, the names could be, depending on how you name your credentials. HTTP Request nodes may contain authentication headers when imported from cURL. Remove or anonymize this information from the JSON file before sharing to protect your credentials.
Import & Export workflows menu
You can export and import workflows in three ways:
From the Editor UI menu:
Export: From the top navigation bar, select the three dots in the upper right, then select Download. This will download your current workflow as a JSON file on your computer.
Import: From the top navigation bar, select the three dots in the upper right, then select Import from URL (to import a published workflow) or Import from File (to import a workflow as a JSON file).
From the Editor UI canvas:
Export: Select all the nodes on the canvas and use Ctrl+C to copy the workflow JSON. You can paste this into a file or share it directly with other people.
Import: You can paste a copied workflow JSON directly into the canvas with Ctrl+V.
From the command line:
Export: See the full list of commands for exporting workflows or credentials.
Import: See the full list of commands for importing workflows or credentials.

Understanding the data structure#
In this chapter, you will learn about the data structure of n8n and how to use the Code node to transform data and simulate node outputs.
Data structure of n8n#
In a basic sense, n8n nodes function as an Extract, Transform, Load (ETL) tool. The nodes allow you to access (extract) data from multiple disparate sources, modify (transform) that data in a particular way, and pass (load) it along to where it needs to be.
The data that moves along from node to node in your workflow must be in a format (structure) that can be recognized and interpreted by each node. In n8n, this required structure is an array of objects.
About array of objects
An array is a list of values. The array can be empty or contain several elements. Each element is stored at a position (index) in the list, starting at 0, and can be referenced by the index number. For example, in the array ["Leonardo", "Michelangelo", "Donatello", "Raphael"]; the element Donatello is stored at index 2.
An object stores key-value pairs, instead of values at numbered indexes as in arrays. The order of the pairs isn't important, as the values can be accessed by referencing the key name. For example, the object below contains two properties (name and color):
1
2
3
4
{
	name: 'Michelangelo',
	color: 'blue',
}



An array of objects is an array that contains one or more objects. For example, the array turtles below contains four objects:
1
 2
 3
 4
 5
 6
 7
 8
 9
10
11
12
13
14
15
16
17
18
var turtles = [
	{
		name: 'Michelangelo',
		color: 'orange',
	},
	{
		name: 'Donatello',
		color: 'purple',
	},
	{
		name: 'Raphael',
		color: 'red',
	},
	{
		name: 'Leonardo',
		color: 'blue',
	}
];



You can access the properties of an object using dot notation with the syntax object.property. For example, turtles[1].color gets the color of the second turtle.
Data sent from one node to another is sent as an array of JSON objects. The elements in this collection are called items.
Items
An n8n node performs its action on each item of incoming data.
Items in the Customer Datastore node
Creating data sets with the Code node#
Now that you are familiar with the n8n data structure, you can use it to create your own data sets or simulate node outputs. To do this, use the Code node to write JavaScript code defining your array of objects with the following structure:
1
2
3
4
5
6
7
return [
	{
		json: {
			apple: 'beets',
		}
	}
];



For example, the array of objects representing the Ninja turtles would look like this in the Code node:
Array of objects in the Code node
JSON objects
Notice that this array of objects contains an extra key: json. n8n expects you to wrap each object in an array in another object, with the key json.
Illustration of data structure in n8n
It's good practice to pass the data in the right structure used by n8n. But don't worry if you forget to add the json key to an item, n8n (version 0.166.0 and above) adds it automatically.
You can also have nested pairs, for example if you want to define a primary and a secondary color. In this case, you need to further wrap the key-value pairs in curly braces {}.
n8n data structure video
This talk offers a more detailed explanation of data structure in n8n.
Exercise#
In a Code node, create an array of objects named myContacts that contains the properties name and email, and the email property is further split into personal and work.
Show me the solution






Referencing node data with the Code node#
Just like you can use expressions to reference data from other nodes, you can also use some methods and variables in the Code node.
Please make sure you read these pages before continuing to the next exercise.
Exercise#
Let's build on the previous exercise, in which you used the Code node to create a data set of two contacts with their names and emails. Now, connect a second Code node to the first one. In the new node, write code to create a new column named workEmail that references the work email of the first contact.
Show me the solution






Transforming data#
The incoming data from some nodes may have a different data structure than the one used in n8n. In this case, you need to transform the data, so that each item can be processed individually.
The two most common operations for data transformation are:
Creating multiple items from one item
Creating a single item from multiple items
There are several ways to transform data for the purposes mentioned above:
Use n8n's data transformation nodes. Use these nodes to modify the structure of incoming data that contain lists (arrays) without needing to use JavaScript code in the Code node:
Use the Split Out node to separate a single data item containing a list into multiple items.
Use the Aggregate node to take separate items, or portions of them, and group them together into individual items.
Use the Code node to write JavaScript functions to modify the data structure of incoming data using the Run Once for All Items mode:
To create multiple items from a single item, you can use JavaScript code like this. This example assumes that the item has a key named data set to an array of items in the form of: [{ "data": [{<item_1>}, {<item_2>}, ...] }]:
1
2
3
4
5
return $input.first().json.data.map(item => {
    return {
        json: item
    }
});



To create a single item from multiple items, you can use this JavaScript code:
1
2
3
4
5
6
7
return [
	{
    	json: {
    		data_object: $input.all().map(item => item.json)
    	}
    }
  ];



These JavaScript examples assume your entire input is what you want to transform. As in the exercise above, you can also execute either operation on a specific field by identifying that in the items list, for example, if our workEmail example had multiple emails in a single field, we could run some code like this:
1
2
3
4
5
6
let items = $input.all();
return items[0].json.workEmail.map(item => {
	return {
		json: item
	}
});



Exercise#
Use the HTTP Request node to make a GET request to the PokéAPI https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/pokemon. (This API requires no authentication).
Transform the data in the results field with the Split Out node.
Transform the data in the results field with the Code node.
Processing different data types#
In this chapter, you will learn how to process different types of data using n8n core nodes.
HTML and XML data#
You're most likely familiar with HTML and XML.
HTML vs. XML
HTML is a markup language used to describe the structure and semantics of a web page. XML looks similar to HTML, but the tag names are different, as they describe the kind of data they hold.
If you need to process HTML or XML data in your n8n workflows, use the HTML node or the XML node.
Use the HTML node to extract HTML content of a webpage by referencing CSS selectors. This is useful if you want to collect structured information from a website (web-scraping).
HTML Exercise#
Let's get the title of the latest n8n blog post:
Use the HTTP Request node to make a GET request to the URL https://blog.n8n.io/ (this endpoint requires no authentication).
Connect an HTML node and configure it to extract the title of the first blog post on the page.
Hint: If you're not familiar with CSS selectors or reading HTML, the CSS selector .post .item-title a should help!
Show me the solution




















Use the XML node to convert XML to JSON and JSON to XML. This operation is useful if you work with different web services that use either XML or JSON and need to get and submit data between them in the two formats.
XML Exercise#
In the final exercise of Chapter 1, you used an HTTP Request node to make a request to the PokéAPI. In this exercise, we'll return to that same API but we'll convert the output to XML:
Add an HTTP Request node that makes the same request to the PokéAPI at https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/pokemon.
Use the XML node to convert the JSON output to XML.
Show me the solution











Date, time, and interval data#
Date and time data types include DATE, TIME, DATETIME, TIMESTAMP, and YEAR. The dates and times can be passed in different formats, for example:
DATE: March 29 2022, 29-03-2022, 2022/03/29
TIME: 08:30:00, 8:30, 20:30
DATETIME: 2022/03/29 08:30:00
TIMESTAMP: 1616108400 (Unix timestamp), 1616108400000 (Unix ms timestamp)
YEAR: 2022, 22
There are a few ways you can work with dates and times:
Use the Date & Time node to convert date and time data to different formats and calculate dates.
Use Schedule Trigger node to schedule workflows to run at a specific time, interval, or duration.
Sometimes, you might need to pause the workflow execution. This might be necessary if you know that a service doesn't process the data instantly or it's slow to return all the results. In these cases, you don't want n8n to pass incomplete data to the next node.
If you run into situations like this, use the Wait node after the node that you want to delay. The Wait node pauses the workflow execution and will resume execution:
At a specific time.
After a specified time interval.
On a webhook call.
Date Exercise#
Build a workflow that adds five days to an input date from the Customer Datastore node that you used before. Then, if the calculated date occurred after 1959, the workflow waits 1 minute before setting the calculated date as a value. The workflow should be triggered every 30 minutes.
To begin:
Add the Customer Datastore (n8n training) node with the Get All People action selected. Return All.
Add the Date & Time node to Round Up the created Date from the datastore to End of Month. Output this to field new-date. Include all input fields.
Add the If node to check if that new rounded date is after 1960-01-01 00:00:00.
Add the Wait node to the True output of that node and set it to wait for one minute.
Add the Edit Fields (Set) node to set a new field called outputValue to a String containing new-date. Include all input fields.
Add the Schedule Trigger node at the beginning of the workflow to trigger it every 30 minutes. (You can keep the Manual Trigger node for testing!)
Show me the solution










































Binary data#
Up to now, you have mainly worked with text data. But what if you want to process data that's not text, like images or PDF files? These types of files are represented in the binary numeral system, so they're considered binary data. In this form, binary data doesn't offer you useful information, so you'll need to convert it into a readable form.
In n8n, you can process binary data with the following nodes:
HTTP Request to request and send files from/to web resources and APIs.
Read/Write Files from Disk to read and write files from/to the machine where n8n is running.
Convert to File to take input data and output it as a file.
Extract From File to get data from a binary format and convert it to JSON.
Reading and writing files is only available on self-hosted n8n
Reading and writing files to disk isn't available on n8n Cloud. You'll read and write to the machine where you installed n8n. If you run n8n in Docker, your command runs in the n8n container and not the Docker host. The Read/Write Files From Disk node looks for files relative to the n8n install path. n8n recommends using absolute file paths to prevent any errors.
To read or write a binary file, you need to write the path (location) of the file in the node's File(s) Selector parameter (for the Read operation) or in the node's File Path and Name parameter (for the Write operation).
Naming the right path
The file path looks slightly different depending on how you are running n8n:
npm: ~/my_file.json
n8n cloud / Docker: /tmp/my_file.json
Binary Exercise 1#
For our first binary exercise, let's convert a PDF file to JSON:
Make an HTTP request to get this PDF file: https://media.kaspersky.com/pdf/Kaspersky_Lab_Whitepaper_Anti_blocker.pdf.
Use the Extract From File node to convert the file from binary to JSON.
Show me the solution







Binary Exercise 2#
For our second binary exercise, let's convert some JSON data to binary:
Make an HTTP request to the Poetry DB API https://poetrydb.org/random/1.
Convert the returned data from JSON to binary using the Convert to File node.
Write the new binary file data to the machine where n8n is running using the Read/Write Files From Disk node.
To check that it worked out, use the Read/Write Files From Disk node to read the generated binary file.
Merging and splitting data#
In this chapter, you will learn how to merge and split data, and in what cases it might be useful to perform these operations.
Merging data#
In some cases, you might need to merge (combine) and process data from different sources.
Merging data can involve:
Creating one data set from multiple sources.
Synchronizing data between multiple systems. This could include removing duplicate data or updating data in one system when it changes in another.
One-way vs. two-way sync
In a one-way sync, data is synchronized in one direction. One system serves as the single source of truth. When information changes in that main system, it automatically changes in the secondary system; but if information changes in the secondary system, the changes aren't reflected in the main system.
In a two-way sync, data is synchronized in both directions (between both systems). When information changes in either of the two systems, it automatically changes in the other one as well.
This blog tutorial explains how to sync data one-way and two-way between two CRMs.
In n8n, you can merge data from two different nodes using the Merge node, which provides several merging options:
Append
Combine
Merge by Fields: requires input fields to match on
Merge by Position
Combine all possible combinations
Choose Branch
Notice that Combine > Merge by Fields requires you enter input fields to match on. These fields should contain identical values between the data sources so n8n can properly match data together. In the Merge node, they're called Input 1 Field and Input 2 Field.
Property Input fields in the Merge node
Property Input in dot notation
If you want to reference nested values in the Merge node parameters Input 1 Field and Input 2 Field, you need to enter the property key in dot-notation format (as text, not as an expression).
Note
You can also find the Merge node under the alias Join. This might be more intuitive if you're familiar with SQL joins.
Merge Exercise#
Build a workflow that merges data from the Customer Datastore node and Code node.
Add a Merge node that takes Input 1 from a Customer Datastore node and Input 2 from a Code node.
In the Customer Datastore node, run the operation Get All People.
In the Code node, create an array of two objects with three properties: name, language, and country, where the property country has two sub-properties code and name.
Fill out the values of these properties with the information of two characters from the Customer Database.
For example, Jay Gatsby's language is English and country name is United States.
In the Merge node, try out different merge options.
Show me the solution







Looping#
In some cases, you might need to perform the same operation on each element of an array or each data item (for example sending a message to every contact in your address book). In technical terms, you need to iterate through the data (with loops).
n8n generally handles this repetitive processing automatically, as the nodes run once for each item, so you don't need to build loops into your workflows.
However, there are some exceptions of nodes and operations that will require you to build a loop into your workflow.
To create a loop in an n8n workflow, you need to connect the output of one node to the input of a previous node, and add an If node to check when to stop the loop.
Splitting data in batches#
If you need to process large volumes of incoming data, execute the Code node multiple times, or avoid API rate limits, it's best to split the data into batches (groups) and process these batches.
For these processes, use the Loop Over Items node. This node splits input data into a specified batch size and, with each iteration, returns a predefined amount of data.
Execution of Loop Over Items node
The Loop Over Items node stops executing after all the incoming items get divided into batches and passed on to the next node in the workflow, so it's not necessary to add an If node to stop the loop.
Loop/Batch Exercise#
Build a workflow that reads the RSS feed from Medium and dev.to. The workflow should consist of three nodes:
A Code node that returns the URLs of the RSS feeds of Medium (https://medium.com/feed/n8n-io) and dev.to (https://dev.to/feed/n8n).
A Loop Over Items node with Batch Size: 1, that takes in the inputs from the Code node and RSS Read node and iterates over the items.
An RSS Read node that gets the URL of the Medium RSS feed, passed as an expression: {{ $json.url }}.
The RSS Read node is one of the exception nodes which processes only the first item it receives, so the Loop Over Items node is necessary for iterating over multiple items.
Dealing with errors in workflows#
Sometimes you build a nice workflow, but it fails when you try to execute it. Workflow executions may fail for a variety of reasons, ranging from straightforward problems with incorrectly configuring a node or a failure in a third-party service to more mysterious errors.
But don't panic. In this lesson, you'll learn how you can troubleshoot errors so you can get your workflow up and running as soon as possible.
Checking failed workflows#
n8n tracks executions of your workflows.
When one of your workflows fails, you can check the Executions log to see what went wrong. The Executions log shows you a list of the latest execution time, status, mode, and running time of your saved workflows.
Open the Executions log by selecting Executions in the left-side panel.
To investigate a specific failed execution from the list, select the name or the View button that appears when you hover over the row of the respective execution.
Executions log
This will open the workflow in read-only mode, where you can see the execution of each node. This representation can help you identify at what point the workflow ran into issues.
To toggle between viewing the execution and the editor, select the Editor | Executions button at the top of the page.
Workflow execution view
Catching erroring workflows#
To catch failed workflows, create a separate Error Workflow with the Error Trigger node. This workflow will only execute if the main workflow execution fails.
Use additional nodes in your Error Workflow that make sense, like sending notifications about the failed workflow and its errors using email or Slack.
To receive error messages for a failed workflow, set the Error Workflow in the Workflow Settings to an Error Workflow that uses an Error Trigger node.
The only difference between a regular workflow and an Error Workflow is that the latter contains an Error Trigger node. Make sure to create this node before you set this as another workflow's designated Error Workflow.
Error workflows
If a workflow uses the Error Trigger node, you don't have to activate the workflow.
If a workflow contains the Error Trigger node, by default, the workflow uses itself as the error workflow.
You can't test error workflows when running workflows manually. The Error trigger only runs when an automatic workflow errors.
You can set the same Error Workflow for multiple workflows.
Exercise#
In the previous chapters, you've built several small workflows. Now, pick one of them that you want to monitor and create an Error Workflow for it:
Create a new Error Workflow.
Add the Error Trigger node.
Connect a node for the communication platform of your choice to the Error Trigger node, like Slack, Discord, Telegram, or even Gmail or a more generic Send Email.
In the workflow you want to monitor, open the Workflow Settings and select the new Error Workflow you just created. Note that this workflow needs to run automatically to trigger the error workflow.
Show me the solution






Throwing exceptions in workflows#
Another way of troubleshooting workflows is to include a Stop and Error node in your workflow. This node throws an error. You can specify the error type:
Error Message: returns a custom message about the error
Error Object: returns the type of error
You can only use the Stop and Error node as the last node in a workflow.
When to throw errors
Throwing exceptions with the Stop and Error node is useful for verifying the data (or assumptions about the data) from a node and returning custom error messages.
If you are working with data from a third-party service, you may come across problems such as:
Wrongly formatted JSON output
Data with the wrong type (for example, numeric data that has a non-numeric value)
Missing values
Errors from remote servers
Though this kind of invalid data might not cause the workflow to fail right away, it could cause problems later on, and then it can become difficult to track the source error. This is why it's better to throw an error at the time you know there might be a problem.
Stop and Error node with error message
Automating a business workflow#
Remember our friend Nathan?
Nathan 🙋: Hello, it's me again. My manager was so impressed with my first workflow automation solution that she entrusted me with more responsibility.
You 👩‍🔧: More work and responsibility. Congratulations, I guess. What do you need to do now?
Nathan 🙋: I got access to all our sales data and I'm now responsible for creating two reports: one for regional sales and one for orders prices. They're based on data from different sources and come in different formats.
You 👩‍🔧: Sounds like a lot of manual work, but the kind that can be automated. Let's do it!
Workflow design#
Now that we know what Nathan wants to automate, let's list the steps he needs to take to achieve this:
Get and combine data from all necessary sources.
Sort the data and format the dates.
Write binary files.
Send notifications using email and Discord.
n8n provides core nodes for all these steps. This use case is somewhat complex. We should build it from three separate workflows:
A workflow that merges the company data with external information.
A workflow that generates the reports.
A workflow that monitors errors in the second workflow.
Workflow prerequisites#
To build the workflows, you will need the following:
An Airtable account and credentials.
A Google account and credentials to access Gmail.
A Discord account and webhook URL (you receive this using email when you sign up for this course).
Next, you will build these three workflows with step-by-step instructions.
Workflow 1: Merging data#
Nathan's company stores its customer data in Airtable. This data contains information about the customers' ID, country, email, and join date, but lacks data about their respective region and subregion. You need to fill in these last two fields in order to create the reports for regional sales.
To accomplish this task, you first need to make a copy of this table in your Airtable account:
Next, build a small workflow that merges data from Airtable and a REST Countries API:
Use the Airtable node to list the data in the Airtable table named customers.
Use the HTTP Request node to get data from the REST Countries API: https://restcountries.com/v3.1/all, and send the query parameter name fields with the value name,region,subregion. This will return data about world countries, split out into separate items.
Use the Merge node to merge data from Airtable and the Countries API by country name, represented as customerCountry in Airtable and name.common in the Countries API, respectively.
Use another Airtable node to update the fields region and subregion in Airtable with the data from the Countries API.
The workflow should look like this:
Workflow 1 for merging data from Airtable and the Countries API
Quiz questions
How many items does the HTTP Request node return?
How many items does the Merge node return?
How many unique regions are assigned in the customers table?
What's the subregion assigned to the customerID 10?
Workflow 2: Generating reports#
In this workflow, you will merge data from different sources, transform binary data, generate files, and send notifications about them. The final workflow should look like this:
Workflow 2 for aggregating data and generating files
To make things easier, let's split the workflow into three parts.
Part 1: Getting data from different sources#
The first part of the workflow consists of five nodes:
Workflow 1: Getting data from different sources
Use the HTTP Request node to get data from the API endpoint that stores company data. Configure the following node parameters:
Method: Get
URL: The Dataset URL you received in the email when you signed up for this course.
Authentication: Generic Credential Type
Generic Auth Type: Header Auth
Credentials for Header Auth: The Header Auth name and Header Auth value you received in the email when you signed up for this course.
Send Headers: Toggle to true
Specify Headers: Select Using Fields Below
Name: unique_id
Value: The unique ID you received in the email when you signed up for this course.
Use the Airtable node to list data from the customers table (where you updated the fields region and subregion).
Use the Merge node to merge data from the Airtable and HTTP Request node, based on matching the input fields for customerID.
Use the Sort node to sort data by orderPrice in descending order.
Quiz questions
What's the name of the employee assigned to customer 1?
What's the order status of customer 2?
What's the highest order price?
Part 2: Generating file for regional sales#
The second part of the workflow consists of four nodes:
Workflow 2: Generating file for regional sales
Use the If node to filter to only display orders from the region Americas.
Use the Convert to File to transform the incoming data from JSON to binary format. Convert each item to a separate file. (Bonus points if you can figure out how to name each report based on the orderID!)
Use the Gmail node (or another email node) to send the files using email to an address you have access to. Note that you need to add an attachment with the data property.
Use the Discord node to send a message in the n8n Discord channel #course-level-two. In the node, configure the following parameters:
Webhook URL: The Discord URL you received in the email when you signed up for this course.
Text: "I sent the file using email with the label ID {label ID}. My ID: " followed by the unique ID emailed to you when you registered for this course.
Note that you need to replace the text in curly braces {} with expressions that reference the data from the nodes.
Quiz questions
How many orders are assigned to the Americas region?
What's the total price of the orders in the Americas region?
How many items does the Write Binary File node return?
Part 3: Generating files for total sales#
The third part of the workflow consists of five nodes:
Workflow 3: Generating files for total sales
Use the Loop Over Items node to split data from the Item Lists node into batches of 5.
Use the Set node to set four values, referenced with expressions from the previous node: customerEmail, customerRegion, customerSince, and orderPrice.
Use the Date & Time node to change the date format of the field customerSince to the format MM/DD/YYYY.
Set the Include Input Fields option to keep all the data together.
Use the Convert to File node to create a CSV spreadsheet with the file name set as the expression: {{$runIndex > 0 ? 'file_low_orders':'file_high_orders'}}.
Use the Discord node to send a message in the n8n Discord channel #course-level-two. In the node, configure the following parameters:
Webhook URL: The Discord URL you received in the email when you signed up for this course.
Text: "I created the spreadsheet {file name}. My ID:" followed by the unique ID emailed to you when you registered for this course.
Note that you need to replace {file name} with an expression that references data from the previous Convert to File node.
Quiz questions
What's the lowest order price in the first batch of items?
What's the formatted date of customer 7?
How many items does the Convert to File node return?
Workflow 3: Monitoring workflow errors#
Last but not least, let's help Nathan know if there are any errors running the workflow.
To accomplish this task, create an Error workflow that monitors the main workflow:
Create a new workflow.
Add an Error Trigger node (and execute it as a test).
Connect a Discord node to the Error Trigger node and configure these fields:


Webhook URL: The Discord URL that you received in the email from n8n when you signed up for this course.
Text: "The workflow {workflow name} failed, with the error message: {execution error message}. Last node executed: {name of the last executed node}. Check this workflow execution here: {execution URL} My Unique ID: " followed by the unique ID emailed to you when you registered for this course.
Note that you need to replace the text in curly brackets {} with expressions that take the respective information from the Error Trigger node.
Execute the Discord node.
Set the newly created workflow as the Error Workflow for the main workflow you created in the previous lesson.
The workflow should look like this:
Workflow 3 for monitoring workflow errors
Quiz questions
What fields does the Error Trigger node return?
What information about the execution does the Error Trigger node return?
What information about the workflow does the Error Trigger node return?
What's the expression to reference the workflow name?
Workflows#
A workflow is a collection of nodes connected together to automate a process.
Create a workflow.
Use Workflow templates to help you get started.
Learn about the key components of an automation in n8n.
Debug using the Executions list.
Share workflows between users.
If it's your first time building a workflow, you may want to use the quickstart guides to quickly try out n8n features.
Create a workflow#
A workflow is a collection of nodes connected together to automate a process. You build workflows on the workflow canvas.
Create a workflow#
Select the  button in the upper-left corner of the side menu. Select workflow.
If your n8n instance supports projects, you'll also need to choose whether to create the workflow inside your personal space or a specific project you have access to. If you're using the community version, you'll always create workflows inside your personal space.
Get started by adding a trigger node: select Add first step...
Or:
Select the  create button in the upper-right corner from either the Overview page or a specific project. Select workflow.
If you're doing this from the Overview page, you'll create the workflow inside your personal space. If you're doing this from inside a project, you'll create the workflow inside that specific project.
Get started by adding a trigger node: select Add first step...
If it's your first time building a workflow, you may want to use the quickstart guides to quickly try out n8n features.
Run workflows manually#
You may need to run your workflow manually when building and testing, or if your workflow doesn't have a trigger node.
To run manually, select Test Workflow.
Run workflows automatically#
All new workflows are inactive by default.
You need to activate workflows that start with a trigger node or Webhook node so that they can run automatically. When a workflow is inactive, you must run it manually.
To activate or deactivate your workflow, open your workflow and toggle Inactive / Active.
Once a workflow is active, it runs whenever its trigger conditions are met.
Nodes#
Nodes are the key building blocks of a workflow. They perform a range of actions, including:
Starting the workflow.
Fetching and sending data.
Processing and manipulating data.
n8n provides a collection of built-in nodes, as well as the ability to create your own nodes. Refer to:
Built-in integrations to browse the node library.
Community nodes for guidance on finding and installing community-created nodes.
Creating nodes to start building your own nodes.
Add a node to your workflow#
Add a node to an empty workflow#
Select Add first step. n8n opens the nodes panel, where you can search or browse trigger nodes.
Select the trigger you want to use.
Choose the correct app event
If you select On App Event, n8n shows a list of all the supported services. Use this list to browse n8n's integrations and trigger a workflow in response to an event in your chosen service. Not all integrations have triggers. To see which ones you can use as a trigger, select the node. If a trigger is available, you'll see it at the top of the available operations list.
For example, this is the trigger for Asana:

Add a node to an existing workflow#
Select the Add node  connector. n8n opens the nodes panel, where you can search or browse all nodes.
Node operations: Triggers and Actions#
When you add a node to a workflow, n8n displays a list of available operations. An operation is something a node does, such as getting or sending data.
There are two types of operation:
Triggers start a workflow in response to specific events or conditions in your services. When you select a Trigger, n8n adds a trigger node to your workflow, with the Trigger operation you chose pre-selected. When you search for a node in n8n, Trigger operations have a bolt icon .
Actions are operations that represent specific tasks within a workflow, which you can use to manipulate data, perform operations on external systems, and trigger events in other systems as part of your workflows. When you select an Action, n8n adds a node to your workflow, with the Action operation you chose pre-selected.
Node controls#
To view node controls, hover over the node on the canvas:
Execute step : Run the node.
Deactivate : Deactivate the node.
Delete : Delete the node.
Node context menu : Select node actions. Available actions:
Open node
Execute step
Rename node
Deactivate node
Pin node
Copy node
Duplicate node
Select all
Clear selection
Delete node
Node settings#
The node settings under the Settings tab allow you to control node behaviors and add node notes.
When active or set, they do the following:
Request Options: Select Add Option to view and select these options.
Batching: Control how to batch large numbers of input items.
Ignore SSL Issues: Download the response even if SSL validation isn't possible.
Proxy: Use this if you need to specify an HTTP proxy.
Timeout: Set a timeout for the request in ms.
Always Output Data: The node returns an empty item even if the node returns no data during execution. Be careful setting this on IF nodes, as it could cause an infinite loop.
Execute Once: The node executes once, with data from the first item it receives. It doesn't process any extra items.
Retry On Fail: When an execution fails, the node reruns until it succeeds.
On Error:
Stop Workflow: Halts the entire workflow when an error occurs, preventing further node execution.
Continue: Proceeds to the next node despite the error, using the last valid data.
Continue (using error output): Continues workflow execution, passing error information to the next node for potential handling.
You can document your workflow using node notes:
Notes: Note to save with the node.
Display note in flow: If active, n8n displays the note in the workflow as a subtitle.
Connections#
A connection establishes a link between nodes to route data through the workflow. A connection between two nodes passes data from one node's output to another node's input.

Create a connection#
To create a connection between two nodes, select the grey dot or Add node  on the right side of a node and slide the arrow to the grey rectangle on the left side of the following node.
Delete a connection#
Hover over the connection, then select Delete .
Sticky Notes#
Sticky Notes allow you to annotate and comment on your workflows.
n8n recommends using Sticky Notes heavily, especially on template workflows, to help other users understand your workflow.

Create a Sticky Note#
Sticky Notes are a core node. To add a new Sticky Note:
Open the nodes panel.
Search for note.
Click the Sticky Note node. n8n adds a new Sticky Note to the canvas.
Edit a Sticky Note#
Double click the Sticky Note you want to edit.
Write your note. This guide explains how to format your text with Markdown. n8n uses markdown-it, which implements the CommonMark specification.
Click away from the note, or press Esc, to stop editing.
Change the color#
To change the Sticky Note color:
Hover over the Sticky Note
Select Change color 
Sticky Note positioning#
You can:
Drag a Sticky Note anywhere on the canvas.
Drag Sticky Notes behind nodes. You can use this to visually group nodes.
Resize Sticky Notes by hovering over the edge of the note and dragging to resize.
Change the color: select Options  to open the color selector.
Writing in Markdown#
Sticky Notes support Markdown formatting. This section describes some common options.

Executions#
An execution is a single run of a workflow.
Execution modes#
There are two execution modes:
Manual: run workflows manually when testing. Select Test Workflow to start a manual execution. You can do manual executions of active workflows, but n8n recommends keeping your workflow set to Inactive while developing and testing.
Production: a production workflow is one that runs automatically. To enable this, set the workflow to Active.
Execution lists#
n8n provides two execution lists:
Workflow-level executions: this execution list shows the executions for a single workflow.
All executions: this list shows all executions for all your workflows.
n8n supports adding custom data to executions.
Manual, partial, and production executions#
There are some important differences in how n8n executes workflows manually (by clicking the Test Workflow button) and automatically (when the workflow is Active and triggered by an event or schedule).
Manual executions#
Manual executions allow you to run workflows directly from the canvas to test your workflow logic. These executions are "ad-hoc": they run only when you manually select the Execute workflow button.
Manual executions make building workflows easier by allowing you to iteratively test as you go, following the flow logic and seeing data transformations. You can test conditional branching, data formatting changes, and loop behavior by providing different input items and modifying node options.
Pinning execution data
When performing manual executions, you can use data pinning to "pin" or "freeze" the output data of a node. You can optionally edit the pinned data as well.
On future runs, instead of executing the pinned node, n8n will substitute the pinned data and continue following the flow logic. This allows you to iterate without operating on variable data or repeating queries to external services. Production executions ignore all pinned data.
Partial executions#
Clicking the Execute workflow button at the bottom of the workflow in the Editor tab manually runs the entire workflow. You can also perform partial executions to run specific steps in your workflow. Partial executions are manual executions that only run a subset of your workflow nodes.
To perform a partial execution, select a node, open its detail view, and select Execute step. This executes the specific node and any preceding nodes required to fill in its input data. You can also temporarily disable specific nodes in the workflow chain to avoid interacting with those services while building.
In particular, partial executions are useful when updating the logic of a specific node since they allow you to re-execute the node with the same input data.
Troubleshooting partial executions#
Some common issues you might come across when running partial executions include the following:
The destination node is not connected to any trigger. Partial executions need a trigger.
This error message appears when you try to perform a partial execution without connecting the workflow to a trigger. Manual executions, including partial executions, attempt to mimic production executions when possible. Part of this includes requiring a trigger node to describe when the workflow logic should execute.
To work around this, connect a trigger node to the workflow with the node you're trying to execute. Most often, a manual trigger is the simplest option.
Please execute the whole workflow, rather than just the node. (Existing execution data is too large.)
This error can appear when performing partial executions on workflows with large numbers of branches. Partial executions involve sending data and workflow logic to the n8n backend in a way that isn't required for full executions. This error occurs when your workflow exceeds the maximum size allowed for these messages.
To work around this, consider using the limit node to limit node output while running partial executions. Once the workflow is running as intended, you can disable or delete the limit node before enabling production execution.
Production executions#
Production executions occur when a triggering event or schedule automatically runs a workflow.
To configure production executions, you must attach a trigger node (any trigger other than the manual trigger works) and switch workflow's toggle to Active. Once activated, the workflow automatically executes whenever the trigger condition occurs.
The execution flow for production executions doesn't display in the Editor tab of the workflow as with manual executions. Instead, you can see executions in the workflow's Executions tab according to your workflow settings. From there, you can explore and troubleshoot problems using the debug in editor feature.
Workflow-level executions list#
The Executions list in a workflow shows all executions for that workflow.
Deleted workflows
When you delete a workflow, n8n deletes its execution history as well. This means you can't view executions for deleted workflows.
Execution history and workflow history
Don't confuse the execution list with Workflow history.
Executions are workflow runs. With the executions list, you can see previous runs of the current version of the workflow. You can copy previous executions into the editor to Debug and re-run past executions in your current workflow.
Workflow history is previous versions of the workflow: for example, a version with a different node, or different parameters set.
View executions for a single workflow#
In the workflow, select the Executions tab in the top menu. You can preview all executions of that workflow.
Filter executions#
You can filter the executions list.
In your workflow, select Executions.
Select Filters.
Enter your filters. You can filter by:
Status: choose from Failed, Running, Success, or Waiting.
Execution start: see executions that started in the given time.
Saved custom data: this is data you create within the workflow using the Code node. Enter the key and value to filter. Refer to Custom executions data for information on adding custom data.
Feature availability
Custom executions data is available on:
Cloud: Pro, Enterprise
Self-Hosted: Enterprise, registered Community
Available in version 0.222.0 and above.
Retry failed workflows#
If your workflow execution fails, you can retry the execution. To retry a failed workflow:
Open the Executions list.
For the workflow execution you want to retry, select Refresh .
Select either of the following options to retry the execution:
Retry with currently saved workflow: Once you make changes to your workflow, you can select this option to execute the workflow with the previous execution data.
Retry with original workflow: If you want to retry the execution without making changes to your workflow, you can select this option to retry the execution with the previous execution data.
All executions#
To view all executions from an n8n instance, navigate to the Overview page and then click into the Executions tab. This will show you all executions from the workflows you have access to.
If your n8n instance supports projects, you'll also be able to view the executions tab within projects you have access to. This will show you executions only from the workflows within the specified project.
Deleted workflows
When you delete a workflow, n8n deletes its execution history as well. This means you can't view executions for deleted workflows.
Filter executions#
You can filter the executions list:
Select the Executions tab either from within the Overview page or a specific project to open the list.
Select Filters.
Enter your filters. You can filter by:
Workflows: choose all workflows, or a specific workflow name.
Status: choose from Failed, Running, Success, or Waiting.
Execution start: see executions that started in the given time.
Saved custom data: this is data you create within the workflow using the Code node. Enter the key and value to filter. Refer to Custom executions data for information on adding custom data.
Feature availability
Custom executions data is available on:
Cloud: Pro, Enterprise
Self-Hosted: Enterprise, registered Community
Available in version 0.222.0 and above.
Retry failed workflows#
If your workflow execution fails, you can retry the execution. To retry a failed workflow:
Select the Executions tab from within either the Overview page or a specific project to open the list.
On the execution you want to retry, select Retry execution .
Select either of the following options to retry the execution:
Retry with currently saved workflow: Once you make changes to your workflow, you can select this option to execute the workflow with the previous execution data.
Retry with original workflow: If you want to retry the execution without making changes to your workflow, you can select this option to retry the execution with the previous execution data.
Load data from previous executions into your current workflow#
You can load data from a previous workflow back into the canvas. Refer to Debug executions for more information.
Custom executions data#
You can set custom data on your workflow using the Code node or the Execution Data node. n8n records this with each execution. You can then use this data when filtering the executions list, or fetch it in your workflows using the Code node.
Feature availability
Custom executions data is available on:
Cloud: Pro, Enterprise
Self-Hosted: Enterprise, registered Community
Available in version 0.222.0 and above.
Set and access custom data using the Code node#
This section describes how to set and access data using the Code node. Refer to Execution Data node for information on using the Execution Data node to set data. You can't retrieve custom data using the Execution Data node.
Set custom executions data#
Set a single piece of extra data:
JavaScript
Python
1
$execution.customData.set("key", "value");



Set all extra data. This overwrites the whole custom data object for this execution:
JavaScript
Python
1
$execution.customData.setAll({"key1": "value1", "key2": "value2"})



There are limitations:
They must be strings
key has a maximum length of 50 characters
value has a maximum length of 255 characters
n8n supports a maximum of 10 items of custom data
Access the custom data object during execution#
You can retrieve the custom data object, or a specific value in it, during an execution:
JavaScript
Python
1
2
3
4
5
// Access the current state of the object during the execution
const customData = $execution.customData.getAll();

// Access a specific value set during this execution
const customData = $execution.customData.get("key");

Debug and re-run past executions#
Feature availability
Available on n8n Cloud and registered Community plans.
You can load data from a previous execution into your current workflow. This is useful for debugging data from failed production executions: you can see a failed execution, make changes to your workflow to fix it, then re-run it with the previous execution data.
Load data#
To load data from a previous execution:
In your workflow, select the Executions tab to view the Executions list.
Select the execution you want to debug. n8n displays options depending on whether the workflow was successful or failed:
For failed executions: select Debug in editor.
For successful executions: select Copy to editor.
n8n copies the execution data into your current workflow, and pins the data in the first node in the workflow.
Check which executions you save
The executions available on the Executions list depends on your Workflow settings.
Tags#
Workflow tags allow you to label your workflows. You can then filter workflows by tag.
Tags are global. This means when you create a tag, it's available to all users on your n8n instance.
Add a tag to a workflow#
To add a tag to your workflow:
In your workflow, select + Add tag.
Select an existing tag, or enter a new tag name.
Once you select a tag and click away from the tag modal, n8n displays the tag next to the workflow name.
You can add more than one tag.
Filter by tag#
When browsing the workflows on your instance, you can filter by tag.
On the Workflows page, select Filters.
Select Tags.
Select the tag or tags you want to filter by. n8n lists the workflows with that tag.
Manage tags#
You can edit existing tags. Instance owners can delete tags.
Select Manage tags. This is available from Filters > Tags on the Workflows page, or in the + Add tag modal in your workflow.
Hover over the tag you want to change.
Select Edit  to rename it, or Delete  to delete it.
Global tags
Tags are global. If you edit or delete a tag, this affects all users of your n8n instance.
Export and import workflows#
n8n saves workflows in JSON format. You can export your workflows as JSON files or import JSON files into your n8n library. You can export and import workflows in several ways.
Sharing credentials
Exported workflow JSON files include credential names and IDs. While IDs aren't sensitive, the names could be, depending on how you name your credentials. HTTP Request nodes may contain authentication headers when imported from cURL. Remove or anonymize this information from the JSON file before sharing to protect your credentials.
Copy-Paste#
You can copy and paste a workflow or parts of it by selecting the nodes you want to copy to the clipboard (Ctrl + c or cmd +c) and pasting it (Ctrl + v or cmd + v) into the Editor UI.
To select all nodes or a group of nodes, click and drag: 
From the Editor UI menu#
From the top navigation bar, select the three dots in the upper right  to see the following options:

Node editing restrictions with unshared credentials#
Sharing in n8n works on the principle of least privilege. This means that if a user shares a workflow with you, but they don't share their credentials, you can't edit the nodes within the workflow that use those credentials. You can view and run the workflow, and edit nodes that don't use unshared credentials.
Refer to Credential sharing for guidance on sharing credentials.
Workflow settings#
You can customize workflow behavior for individual workflows using workflow settings.
To open the settings:
Open your workflow.
Select the Options  menu.
Select Settings. n8n opens the Workflow settings modal.
The following settings are available:
Execution order: choose the execution order for multi-branch workflows. v0 (legacy) executes the first node of each branch, then the second node of each branch, and so on. v1 (recommended) executes each branch in turn, completing one branch before starting another. n8n orders the branches based on their position on the canvas, from topmost to bottommost. If two branches are at the same height, the leftmost branch executes first.
Error Workflow: select a workflow to trigger if the current workflow fails. See Error workflows for more details.
This workflow can be called by: choose whether other workflow can call this workflow.
Timezone: sets the timezone for the workflow to use. The default timezone is EDT (New York). The timezone setting is important for the Schedule Trigger node.
Save failed production executions: whether n8n should save failed executions for active workflows.
Save successful production executions: whether n8n should save successful executions for active workflows.
Save manual executions: whether n8n should save executions for workflows started by the user in the editor.
Save execution progress: whether n8n should save execution data for each node. If set to Save, the workflow resumes from where it stopped in case of an error. This might increase latency.
Timeout Workflow: toggle to enable setting a duration after which n8n should cancel the current workflow execution.
Timeout After: Set the time in hours, minutes, and seconds after which the workflow should timeout. For n8n Cloud users n8n enforces a maximum available timeout for each plan.
Workflow history#
Feature availability
Full workflow history is available on Enterprise Cloud and Enterprise Self-hosted.
Versions from the last five days are available for Cloud Pro users.
Versions from the last 24 hours are available for registered Community users.
Use workflow history to view and restore previous versions of your workflows.
Understand workflow history#
n8n creates a new version when you:
Save your workflow.
Restore an old version. n8n saves the latest version before restoring.
Pull from a Git repository using Source control. Note that n8n saves versions to the instance database, not to Git.
Workflow history and execution history
Don't confuse workflow history with the Workflow-level executions list.
Executions are workflow runs. With the executions list, you can see previous runs of the current version of the workflow. You can copy previous executions into the editor to Debug and re-run past executions in your current workflow.
Workflow history is previous versions of the workflow: for example, a version with a different node, or different parameters set.
View workflow history#
To view a workflow's history:
Open the workflow.
Select Workflow history . n8n opens a menu showing the saved workflow versions, and a canvas with a preview of the selected version.
Restore or copy previous versions#
You can restore a previous workflow version, or make a copy of it:
On the version you want to restore or copy, select Options .
Choose what you want to do:
Restore this version: replace your current workflow with the selected version.
Clone to new workflow: create a new workflow based on the selected version.
Open version in new tab: open a second tab displaying the selected version. Use this to compare versions.
Download: download the version as JSON.
Find your workflow ID#
Your workflow ID is available in:
The URL of the open workflow.
The workflow settings title.
Sub-workflow conversion#
Feature availability
Available on all plans from n8n version 1.97.0.
Use sub-workflow conversion to refactor your workflows into reusable parts. Expressions referencing other nodes are automatically updated and added as parameters in the Execute Workflow Trigger node.
See sub-workflows for a general introduction to the concept.
Selecting nodes for a sub-workflow#
To convert part of a workflow to a sub-workflow, you must select the nodes in the original workflow that you want to convert.
Do this by selecting a group of valid nodes. The selection must be continuous and must connect to the rest of the workflow from at most one start node and one end node. The selection must fulfill these conditions:
Must not include trigger nodes.
Only a single node in the selection can have incoming connections from nodes outside of the selection.
That node can have multiple incoming connections, but only a single input branch (which means it can't be a Merge node for example).
That node can't have incoming connections from other nodes in the selection.
Only a single node in the selection can have outgoing connections to nodes outside of the selection.
That node can have multiple outgoing connections, but only a single output branch (it can't be an If node for example).
That node can't have outgoing connections to other nodes in the selection.
The selection must include all nodes between the input and output nodes.
How to convert part of a workflow to a sub-workflow#
Select the desired nodes on the canvas. Right-click the canvas background and select Convert to sub-workflow.
Things to keep in mind#
Most sub-workflow conversions work without issues, but there are some caveats and limitations to keep in mind:
You must set type constraints for input and output manually: By default, sub-workflow input and output allow all types. You can set expected types in sub-workflow's Execute Sub-workflow Trigger node and Edit Fields (set) node (labeled as Return and only included if the sub-workflow has outputs).
Limited support for AI nodes: When dealing with sub-nodes like AI tools, you must select them all and may need to duplicate any nodes shared with other AI Agents before conversion.
Uses v1 execution ordering: New workflows use v1 execution ordering regardless of the parent workflow's settings - you can change this back in the settings.
Accessor functions like first(), last(), and all() require extra care: Expressions using these functions don't always translate cleanly to a sub-workflow context. n8n may transform them to try to preserve their functionality, but you should check that they work as intended in their new context.
Sub-node parameter suffixes
n8n adds suffixes like _firstItem, _lastItem, and _allItems to variable names accessed by these functions. This helps preserve information about the original expression, since item ordering may be different in the sub-workflow context.
The itemMatching function requires a fixed index: You can't use expressions for the index value when using the itemMatching function. You must pass it a fixed number.
Credentials#
Credentials are private pieces of information issued by apps and services to authenticate you as a user and allow you to connect and share information between the app or service and the n8n node.
Access the credentials UI by opening the left menu and selecting Credentials. n8n lists credentials you created on the My credentials tab. The All credentials tab shows all credentials you can use, included credentials shared with you by other users.
Create and edit credentials.
Learn about credential sharing.
Find information on setting up credentials for your services in the credentials library.
Create and edit credentials#
Credentials are securely stored authentication information used to connect n8n workflows to external services such as APIs, or databases.
Create a credential#
Select the  button in the upper-left corner of the side menu. Select credential.
If your n8n instance supports projects, you'll also need to choose whether to create the credential inside your personal space or a specific project you have access to. If you're using the community version, you'll create the credential inside your personal space.
Select the app or service you wish to connect to.
Or:
Using the  Create button in the upper-right corner from either the Overview page or a specific project. Select Credential.
If you're doing this from the Overview page, you'll create the credential inside your personal space. If you're doing this from inside a project, you'll create the credential inside that specific project.
Select the app or service you wish to connect to.
You can also create new credential in the credential drop down when editing a node on the workflow editor.
Once in the credential modal, enter the details required by your service. Refer to your service's page in the credentials library for guidance.
When you save a credential, n8n tests it to confirm it works.
Credentials naming
n8n names new credentials "node name account" by default. You can rename the credentials by clicking on the name, similarly to renaming nodes. It's good practice to give them names that identify the app or service, type, and purpose of the credential. A naming convention makes it easier to keep track of and identify your credentials.
Expressions in credentials#
You can use expressions to set credentials dynamically as your workflow runs:
In your workflow, find the data path containing the credential. This varies depending on the exact parameter names in your data. Make sure that the data containing the credential is available in the workflow when you get to the node that needs it.
When creating your credential, hover over the field where you want to use an expression.
Toggle Expression on.
Enter your expression.
Example workflow#

The example workflows use Sticky Notes to guide you:
Yellow: notes and information.
Green: instructions to run the workflow.
Orange: you need to change something to make the workflow work.
Blue: draws attention to a key feature of the example.
Credential sharing#
Feature availability
Available on all Cloud plans, and Enterprise self-hosted plans.
You can share a credential directly with other users to use in their own workflows. Or share a credential in a project for all members of that project to use. Any users using a shared credential won't be able to view or edit the credential details.
Users can share credentials they created and own. Only project admins can share credentials created in and owned by a project. Instance owners and instance admins can view and share all credentials on an instance.
Refer to Account types for more information about owners and admins.
In projects, a user's role controls how they can interact with the workflows and credentials associated to the projects they're a member of.
Share a credential#
To share a credential:
From the left menu, select either Overview or a project.
Select Credentials to see a list of your credentials.
Select the credential you want to share.
Select Sharing.
In the Share with projects or users dropdown, browse or search for the user or project with which you want to share your credentials.
Select a user or project.
Select Save to apply the changes.
Remove access to a credential#
To unshare a credential:
From the left menu, select either Overview or a project.
Select Credentials to see a list of your credentials.
Select the credential you want to unshare.

This section includes guides to configuring LDAP and SAML in n8n.
Set up user management on n8n Cloud#
To access user management, upgrade to version 0.195.0 or newer.
Irreversible upgrade
Once you upgrade your Cloud instance to an n8n version with user management, you can't downgrade your version.
Step one: In-app setup#
When you set up user management for the first time, you create an owner account.
Open n8n. The app displays a signup screen.
Enter your details. Your password must be at least eight characters, including at least one number and one capital letter.
Click Next. n8n logs you in with your new owner account.
Step two: Invite users#
You can now invite other people to your n8n instance.
Sign into your workspace with your owner account. (If you are in the Admin Panel open your Workspace from the Dashboard)
Click the three dots next to your user icon at the bottom left and click Settings. n8n opens your Personal settings page.
Click Users to go to the Users page.
Click Invite.
Enter the new user's email address.
Click Invite user. n8n sends an email with a link for the new user to join.
Manage users#
The Settings > Users page shows all users, including ones with pending invitations.
Delete a user#
Select the menu icon by the user you want to delete.
Confirm you want to delete them.
If they're an active user, choose whether to copy their workflow data and credentials to a new user, or permanently delete their workflows and credentials.
Resend an invitation to a pending user#
Click the menu icon by the user, then click Resend invite.
Account types#
There are three account types: owner, admin, and member. The account type affects the user permissions and access.
Feature availability
To use admin accounts, you need a pro or enterprise plan.
Account types and role types
Account types and role types are different things. Role types are part of RBAC.
Every account has one type. The account can have different role types for different projects.
Create a member-level account for the owner
n8n recommends that owners create a member-level account for themselves. Owners can see and edit all workflows, credentials, and projects. However, there is no way to see who created a particular workflow, so there is a risk of overriding other people's work if you build and edit workflows as an owner.

Role-based access control (RBAC)#
Feature availability
RBAC is available on all plans except the Community edition. Different plans have different numbers of projects and roles. Refer to n8n's pricing page for plan details.
Role types and account types
Role types and account types are different things. Every account has one type. The account can have different role types for different projects.
RBAC is a way of managing access to workflows and credentials based on user roles and projects. You group workflows into projects, and user access depends on the user's project role. This section provides guidance on using RBAC in n8n.
Role types
Projects
RBAC role types#
Feature availability
The Project Editor role is available on Pro Cloud and Self-hosted Enterprise plans.
The Project Viewer role is only available on Self-hosted Enterprise and Cloud Enterprise plans.
Within projects, there are three user roles: Admin, Editor, and Viewer. These roles control what the user can do in a project. A user can have different roles within different projects.
Project Admin#
A Project Admin role has the highest level of permissions. Project admins can:
Manage project settings: Change name, delete project.
Manage project members: Invite members and remove members, change members' roles.
View, create, update, and delete any workflows, credentials, or executions within a project.
Project Editor#
A Project Editor can view, create, update, and delete any workflows, credentials, or executions within a project.
Project Viewer#
A Project Viewer is effectively a read-only role with access to all workflows, credentials, and executions within a project.
Viewers aren't able to manually execute any workflows that exist in a project.
Role types and account types
Role types and account types are different things. Every account has one type. The account can have different role types for different projects.

Projects
Feature availability
RBAC is available on all plans except the Community edition. Different plans have different numbers of projects and roles. Refer to n8n's pricing page for plan details.
n8n uses projects to group workflows and credentials, and assigns roles to users in each project. This means that a single user can have different roles in different projects, giving them different levels of access.
Create a project#
Instance owners and instance admins can create projects.
To create a project:
Select  Add project.
Fill out the project settings.
Select Save.
Add and remove users in a project#
Project admins can add and remove users.
To add a user to a project:
Select the project.
Select Project settings.
Under Project members, browse for users or search by username or email address.
Select the user you want to add.
Check the role type and change it if needed.
Select Save.
To remove a user from a project:
Select the project.
Select Project settings.
In the role type dropdown for the user you want to remove, select Remove access.
Select Save.
Delete a project#
To delete a project:
Select the project.
Select Project settings.
Select Delete project.
Choose what to do with the workflows and credentials. You can select:
Transfer its workflows and credentials to another project: n8n prompts you to choose a project to move the data to.
Delete its workflows and credentials: n8n prompts you to confirm that you want to delete all the data in the project.
Move workflows and credentials between projects or users#
Workflow and credential owners can move workflows or credentials (changing ownership) to other users or projects they have access to.
Moving revokes sharing
Moving workflows or credentials removes all existing sharing. Be aware that this could impact other workflows currently sharing these resources.
Select Workflow menu  or Credential menu  > Move.
Moving workflows with credentials
When moving a workflow with credentials you have permission to share, you can choose to share the credentials as well. This ensures that the workflow continues to have access to the credentials it needs to execute. n8n will note any credentials that can't be moved (credentials you don't have permission to share).
Select the project or user you want to move to.
Select Next.
Confirm you understand the impact of the move: workflows may stop working if the credentials they need aren't available in the target project, and n8n removes any current individual sharing.
Select Confirm move to new project.
Using external secrets in projects#
To use external secrets in a project, you must have an instance owner or instance admin as a member of the project.
Best practices for user management#
This page contains advice on best practices relating to user management in n8n.
All platforms#
n8n recommends that owners create a member-level account for themselves. Owners can see all workflows, but there is no way to see who created a particular workflow, so there is a risk of overriding other people's work if you build and edit workflows as an owner.
Users must be careful not to edit the same workflow simultaneously. It's possible to do it, but the users will overwrite each other's changes.
To move workflows between accounts, export the workflow as JSON, then import it to the new account. Note that this action loses the workflow history.
Webhook paths must be unique across the entire instance. This means each webhook path must be unique for all workflows and all users. By default, n8n generates a long random value for the webhook path, but users can edit this to their own custom path. If two users set the same path value:
The path works for the first workflow that's run or activated.
Other workflows will error if they try to run with the same path.
Self-hosted#
If you run n8n behind a reverse proxy, set the following environment variables so that n8n generates emails with the correct URL:
N8N_HOST
N8N_PORT
N8N_PROTOCOL
N8N_EDITOR_BASE_URL
More information on these variables is available in Environment variables.
Two-factor authentication (2FA)#
Two-factor authentication (2FA) adds a second authentication method on top of username and password. This increases account security. n8n supports 2FA using an authenticator app.
Enable 2FA#
You need an authenticator app on your phone.
To enable 2FA in n8n:
Go to you Settings > Personal.
Select Enable 2FA. n8n opens a modal with a QR code.
Scan the QR code in your authenticator app.
Enter the code from your app in Code from authenticator app.
Select Continue. n8n displays recovery codes.
Save the recovery codes. You need these to regain access to your account if you lose your authenticator.
Disable 2FA for your instance#
Self-hosted users can configure their n8n instance to disable 2FA for all users by setting N8N_MFA_ENABLED to false. Note that n8n ignores this if existing users have 2FA enabled. Refer to Configuration methods for more information on configuring your n8n instance with environment variables.
Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP)#
Feature availability
Available on Self-hosted Enterprise and Cloud Enterprise plans.
You need access to the n8n instance owner account.
This page tells you how to enable LDAP in n8n. It assumes you're familiar with LDAP, and have an existing LDAP server set up.
LDAP allows users to sign in to n8n with their organization credentials, instead of an n8n login.
Enable LDAP#
Log in to n8n as the instance owner.
Select Settings  > LDAP.
Toggle on Enable LDAP Login.
Complete the fields with details from your LDAP server.
Select Test connection to check your connection setup, or Save connection to create the connection.
After enabling LDAP, anyone on your LDAP server can sign in to the n8n instance, unless you exclude them using the User Filter setting.
You can still create non-LDAP users (email users) on the Settings > Users page.
Merging n8n and LDAP accounts#
If n8n finds matching accounts (matching emails) for email users and LDAP users, the user must sign in with their LDAP account. n8n instance owner accounts are excluded from this: n8n never converts owner accounts to LDAP users.
LDAP user accounts in n8n#
On first sign in, n8n creates a user account in n8n for the LDAP user.
You must manage user details on the LDAP server, not in n8n. If you update or delete a user on your LDAP server, the n8n account updates at the next scheduled sync, or when the user next tries to log in, whichever happens first.
User deletion
If you remove a user from your LDAP server, they lose n8n access on the next sync.
Turn LDAP off#
To turn LDAP off:
Log in to n8n as the instance owner.
Select Settings  > LDAP.
Toggle off Enable LDAP Login.
If you turn LDAP off, n8n converts existing LDAP users to email users on their next login. The users must reset their password.

Flow logic#
n8n allows you to represent complex logic in your workflows.
This section covers:
Splitting with conditionals
Merging data
Looping
Waiting
Sub-workflows
Error handling
Execution order in multi-branch workflows
Related sections#
You need some understanding of Data in n8n, including Data structure and Data flow within nodes.
When building your logic, you'll use n8n's Core nodes, including:
Splitting: IF and Switch.
Merging: Merge, Compare Datasets, and Code.
Looping: IF and Loop Over Items.
Waiting: Wait.
Creating sub-workflows: Execute Workflow and Execute Workflow Trigger.
Error handling: Stop And Error and Error Trigger.
Splitting workflows with conditional nodes#
Splitting uses the IF or Switch nodes. It turns a single-branch workflow into a multi-branch workflow. This is a key piece of representing complex logic in n8n.
Compare these workflows:

This is the power of splitting and conditional nodes in n8n.
Refer to the IF or Switch documentation for usage details.
Merging data#
Merging brings multiple data streams together. You can achieve this using different nodes depending on your workflow requirements.
Merge data from different data streams or nodes: Use the Merge node to combine data from various sources into one.
Merge data from multiple node executions: Use the Code node for complex scenarios where you need to merge data from multiple executions of a node or multiple nodes.
Compare and merge data: Use the Compare Datasets node to compare, merge, and output data streams based on the comparison.
Explore each method in more detail in the sections below.
Merge data from different data streams#
If your workflow splits, you combine the separate streams back into one stream.
Here's an example workflow showing different types of merging: appending data sets, keeping only new items, and keeping only existing items. The Merge node documentation contains details on each of the merge operations.
Click to explore
View template details
Merge data from different nodes#
You can use the Merge node to combine data from two previous nodes, even if the workflow hasn't split into separate data streams. This can be useful if you want to generate a single dataset from the data generated by multiple nodes.
Merging data from two previous nodes
Merge data from multiple node executions#
Use the Code node to merge data from multiple node executions. This is useful in some Looping scenarios.
Node executions and workflow executions
This section describes merging data from multiple node executions. This is when a node executes multiple times during a single workflow execution.
Refer to this example workflow using Loop Over Items and Wait to artificially create multiple executions.

Compare, merge, and split again#
The Compare Datasets node compares data streams before merging them. It outputs up to four different data streams.
Refer to this example workflow for an example.

Looping in n8n#
Looping is useful when you want to process multiple items or perform an action repeatedly, such as sending a message to every contact in your address book. n8n handles this repetitive processing automatically, meaning you don't need to specifically build loops into your workflows. There are some nodes where this isn't true.
Using loops in n8n#
n8n nodes take any number of items as input, process these items, and output the results. You can think of each item as a single data point, or a single row in the output table of a node.

Nodes usually run once for each item. For example, if you wanted to send the name and notes of the customers in the Customer Datastore node as a message on Slack, you would:
Connect the Slack node to the Customer Datastore node.
Configure the parameters.
Execute the node.
You would receive five messages: one for each item.
This is how you can process multiple items without having to explicitly connect nodes in a loop.
Executing nodes once#
For situations where you don't want a node to process all received items, for example sending a Slack message only to the first customer, you can do so by toggling the Execute Once parameter in the Settings tab of that node This setting is helpful when the incoming data contains multiple items and you want to only process the first one.
Creating loops#
n8n typically handles the iteration for all incoming items. However, there are certain scenarios where you will have to create a loop to iterate through all items. Refer to Node exceptions for a list of nodes that don't automatically iterate over all incoming items.
Loop until a condition is met#
To create a loop in an n8n workflow, connect the output of one node to the input of a previous node. Add an IF node to check when to stop the loop.
Here is an example workflow that implements a loop with an IF node:

Loop until all items are processed#
Use the Loop Over Items node when you want to loop until all items are processed. To process each item individually, set Batch Size to 1.
You can batch the data in groups and process these batches. This approach is useful for avoiding API rate limits when processing large incoming data or when you want to process a specific group of returned items.
The Loop Over Items node stops executing after all the incoming items get divided into batches and passed on to the next node in the workflow so it's not necessary to add an IF node to stop the loop.
Node exceptions#
Nodes and operations where you need to design a loop into your workflow:
CrateDB executes once for insert and update.
Code node in Run Once for All Items mode: processes all the items based on the entered code snippet.
Execute Workflow node in Run Once for All Items mode.
HTTP Request: you must handle pagination yourself. If your API call returns paginated results you must create a loop to fetch one page at a time.
Microsoft SQL executes once for insert, update, and delete.
MongoDB executes once for insert and update.
QuestDB executes once for insert.
Redis:
Info: this operation executes only once, regardless of the number of items in the incoming data.
RSS Read executes once for the requested URL.
TimescaleDB executes once for insert and update.
Waiting#
Waiting allows you to pause a workflow mid-execution, then resume where the workflow left off, with the same data. This is useful if you need to rate limit your calls to a service, or wait for an external event to complete. You can wait for a specified duration, or until a webhook fires.
Making a workflow wait uses the Wait node. Refer to the node documentation for usage details.
n8n provides a workflow template with a basic example of Rate limiting and waiting for external events.
Sub-workflows#
You can call one workflow from another workflow. This allows you to build modular, microservice-like workflows. It can also help if your workflow grows large enough to encounter memory issues. Creating sub-workflows uses the Execute Workflow and Execute Sub-workflow Trigger nodes.
Sub-wokflow executions don't count towards your plan's monthly execution or active workflow limits.
Set up and use a sub-workflow#
This section walks through setting up both the parent workflow and sub-workflow.
Create the sub-workflow#
Create a new workflow.
Create sub-workflows from existing workflows
You can optionally create a sub-workflow directly from an existing parent workflow using the Execute Sub-workflow node. In the node, select the Database and From list options and select Create a sub-workflow in the list.
You can also extract selected nodes directly using Sub-workflow conversion in the context menu.
Optional: configure which workflows can call the sub-workflow:
Select the Options  menu > Settings. n8n opens the Workflow settings modal.
Change the This workflow can be called by setting. Refer to Workflow settings for more information on configuring your workflows.
Add the Execute Sub-workflow trigger node (if you are searching under trigger nodes, this is also titled When Executed by Another Workflow).
Set the Input data mode to choose how you will define the sub-workflow's input data:
Define using fields below: Choose this mode to define individual input names and data types that the calling workflow needs to provide. The Execute Sub-workflow node or Call n8n Workflow Tool node in the calling workflow will automatically pull in the fields defined here.
Define using JSON example: Choose this mode to provide an example JSON object that demonstrates the expected input items and their types.
Accept all data: Choose this mode to accept all data unconditionally. The sub-workflow won't define any required input items. This sub-workflow must handle any input inconsistencies or missing values.
Add other nodes as needed to build your sub-workflow functionality.
Save the sub-workflow.
Sub-workflow mustn't contain errors
If there are errors in the sub-workflow, the parent workflow can't trigger it.
Load data into sub-workflow before building
This requires the ability to load data from previous executions, which is available on n8n Cloud and registered Community plans.
If you want to load data into your sub-workflow to use while building it:
Create the sub-workflow and add the Execute Sub-workflow Trigger.
Set the node's Input data mode to Accept all data or define the input items using fields or JSON if they're already known.
In the sub-workflow settings, set Save successful production executions to Save.
Skip ahead to setting up the parent workflow, and run it.
Follow the steps to load data from previous executions.
Adjust the Input data mode to match the input sent by the parent workflow if necessary.
You can now pin example data in the trigger node, enabling you to work with real data while configuring the rest of the workflow.
Call the sub-workflow#
Open the workflow where you want to call the sub-workflow.
Add the Execute Sub-workflow node.
In the Execute Sub-workflow node, set the sub-workflow you want to call. You can choose to call the workflow by ID, load a workflow from a local file, add workflow JSON as a parameter in the node, or target a workflow by URL.
Find your workflow ID
Your sub-workflow's ID is the alphanumeric string at the end of its URL.
Fill in the required input items defined by the sub-workflow.
Save your workflow.
When your workflow executes, it will send data to the sub-workflow, and run it.
You can follow the execution flow from the parent workflow to the sub-workflow by opening the Execute Sub-workflow node and selecting the View sub-execution link. Likewise, the sub-workflow's execution contains a link back to the parent workflow's execution to navigate in the other direction.
How data passes between workflows#
As an example, imagine you have an Execute Sub-workflow node in Workflow A. The Execute Sub-workflow node calls another workflow called Workflow B:
The Execute Sub-workflow node passes the data to the Execute Sub-workflow Trigger node (titled "When executed by another node" in the canvas) of Workflow B.
The last node of Workflow B sends the data back to the Execute Sub-workflow node in Workflow A.
Sub-workflow conversion#
See sub-workflow conversion for how to divide your existing workflows into sub-workflows.
Error handling#
When designing your flow logic, it's a good practice to consider potential errors, and set up methods to handle them gracefully. With an error workflow, you can control how n8n responds to a workflow execution failure.
Investigating errors
To investigate failed executions, you can:
Review your Executions, for a single workflow or all workflows you have access to. You can load data from previous execution into your current workflow.
Enable Log streaming.
Create and set an error workflow#
For each workflow, you can set an error workflow in Workflow Settings. It runs if an execution fails. This means you can, for example, send email or Slack alerts when a workflow execution errors. The error workflow must start with the Error Trigger.
You can use the same error workflow for multiple workflows.
Create a new workflow, with the Error Trigger as the first node.
Give the workflow a name, for example Error Handler.
Select Save.
In the workflow where you want to use this error workflow:
Select Options  > Settings.
In Error workflow, select the workflow you just created. For example, if you used the name Error Handler, select Error handler.
Select Save. Now, when this workflow errors, the related error workflow runs.
Error data#
The default error data received by the Error Trigger is:
1

All information is always present, except:
execution.id: requires the execution to be saved in the database. Not present if the error is in the trigger node of the main workflow, as the workflow doesn't execute.
execution.url: requires the execution to be saved in the database. Not present if the error is in the trigger node of the main workflow, as the workflow doesn't execute.
execution.retryOf: only present when the execution is a retry of a failed execution.
If the error is caused by the trigger node of the main workflow, rather than a later stage, the data sent to the error workflow is different. There's less information in execution{} and more in trigger{}:

Cause a workflow execution failure using Stop And Error#
When you create and set an error workflow, n8n runs it when an execution fails. Usually, this is due to things like errors in node settings, or the workflow running out of memory.
You can add the Stop And Error node to your workflow to force executions to fail under your chosen circumstances, and trigger the error workflow.
Execution order in multi-branch workflows#
n8n's node execution order depends on the version of n8n you're using:
For workflows created before version 1.0: n8n executes the first node of each branch, then the second node of each branch, and so on.
For workflows created in version 1.0 and above: executes each branch in turn, completing one branch before starting another. n8n orders the branches based on their position on the canvas, from topmost to bottommost. If two branches are at the same height, the leftmost branch executes first.
You can change the execution order in your workflow settings.
Data#
Data is the information that n8n nodes receive and process. For basic usage of n8n you don't need to understand data structures and manipulation. However, it becomes important if you want to:
Create your own node
Write custom expressions
Use the Function or Function Item node
This section covers:
Data structure
Data flow within nodes
Transforming data
Process data using code
Pinning and editing data during workflow development.
Data mapping and Item linking: how data items link to each other.
Related resources#
Data transformation nodes#
n8n provides a collection of nodes to transform data:
Aggregate: take separate items, or portions of them, and group them together into individual items.
Limit: remove items beyond a defined maximum number.
Remove Duplicates: identify and delete items that are identical across all fields or a subset of fields.
Sort: organize lists of in a desired ordering, or generate a random selection.
Split Out: separate a single data item containing a list into multiple items.
Summarize: aggregate items together, in a manner similar to Excel pivot tables.
Data structure#
In n8n, all data passed between nodes is an array of objects. It has the following structure:
1
 2
 3
 4
 5
 6
 7
 8
 9
10
11
12
13

[
	{
		// For most data:
		// Wrap each item in another object, with the key 'json'
		"json": {
			// Example data
			"apple": "beets",
			"carrot": {
				"dill": 1
			}
		},
		// For binary data:
		// Wrap each item in another object, with the key 'binary'
		"binary": {
			// Example data
			"apple-picture": {
				"data": "....", // Base64 encoded binary data (required)
				"mimeType": "image/png", // Best practice to set if possible (optional)
				"fileExtension": "png", // Best practice to set if possible (optional)
				"fileName": "example.png", // Best practice to set if possible (optional)
			}
		}
	},
]



Skipping the json key and array syntax
From 0.166.0 on, when using the Function node or Code node, n8n automatically adds the json key if it's missing. It also automatically wraps your items in an array ([]) if needed. This is only the case when using the Function or Code nodes. When building your own nodes, you must still make sure the node returns data with the json key.
Data item processing#
Nodes can process multiple items.
For example, if you set the Trello node to Create-Card, and create an expression that sets Name using a property called name-input-value from the incoming data, the node creates a card for each item, always choosing the name-input-value of the current item.
For example, this input will create two cards. One named test1 the other one named test2:
1
2
3
4
5
6
7
8
[
	{
		name-input-value: "test1"
	},
	{
		name-input-value: "test2"
	}
]

Data flow within nodes#
Nodes can process multiple items.
For example, if you set the Trello node to Create-Card, and create an expression that sets Name using a property called name-input-value from the incoming data, the node creates a card for each item, always choosing the name-input-value of the current item.
For example, this input will create two cards. One named test1 the other one named test2:
1
2
3
4
5
6
7
8
[
	{
		name-input-value: "test1"
	},
	{
		name-input-value: "test2"
	}
]

Transforming data#
n8n uses a predefined data structure that allows all nodes to process incoming data correctly.
Your incoming data may have a different data structure, in which case you will need to transform it to allow each item to be processed individually.
For example, the image below shows the output of an HTTP Request node that returns data incompatible with n8n's data structure. The node returns the data and displays that only one item was returned.

To transform this kind of structure into the n8n data structure you can use the data transformation nodes:
Aggregate: take separate items, or portions of them, and group them together into individual items.
Limit: remove items beyond a defined maximum number.
Remove Duplicates: identify and delete items that are identical across all fields or a subset of fields.
Sort: organize lists of in a desired ordering, or generate a random selection.
Split Out: separate a single data item containing a list into multiple items.
Summarize: aggregate items together, in a manner similar to Excel pivot tables.
Processing data with code#
Function#
A function is a block of code designed to perform a certain task. In n8n, you can write custom JavaScript or Python code snippets to add, remove, and update the data you receive from a node.
The Code node gives you access to the incoming data and you can manipulate it. With this node you can create any function you want using JavaScript code.
Data mapping#
Data mapping means referencing data from previous nodes.
This section contains guidance on:
Mapping data in most scenarios: Data mapping in the UI and Data mapping in expression
How to handle item linking when using the Code node or building your own nodes.
Mapping in the UI#
Data mapping means referencing data from previous nodes. It doesn't include changing (transforming) data, just referencing it.
You can map data in the following ways:
Using the expressions editor.
By dragging and dropping data from the INPUT into parameters. This generates the expression for you.
For information on errors with mapping and linking items, refer to Item linking errors.
How to drag and drop data#
Run your workflow to load data.
Open the node where you need to map data.
You can map in table, JSON, and schema view:
In table view: click and hold a table heading to map top level data, or a field in the table to map nested data.
In JSON view: click and hold a key.
In schema view: click and hold a key.
Drag the item into the field where you want to use the data.
Understand what you're mapping with drag and drop#
Data mapping maps the key path, and loads the key's value into the field. For example, given the following data:
1
2
3
4
5
6
[
	{
		"fruit": "apples",
		"color": "green"
	}
]



You can map fruit by dragging and dropping fruit from the INPUT into the field where you want to use its value. This creates an expression, {{ $json.fruit }}. When the node iterates over input items, the value of the field becomes the value of fruit for each item.
Understand nested data#
Given the following data:
1
 2
 3
 4
 5
 6
 7
 8
 9
10
11
12
13
14
15
16
[
  {
    "name": "First item",
    "nested": {
      "example-number-field": 1,
      "example-string-field": "apples"
    }
  },
  {
    "name": "Second item",
    "nested": {
      "example-number-field": 2,
      "example-string-field": "oranges"
    }
  }
]



n8n displays it in table form like this:

Mapping in the expressions editor#
These examples show how to access linked items in the expressions editor. Refer to expressions for more information on expressions, including built in variables and methods.
For information on errors with mapping and linking items, refer to Item linking errors.
Access the linked item in a previous node's output#
When you use this, n8n works back up the item linking chain, to find the parent item in the given node.
1
2
// Returns the linked item
{{$("<node-name>").item}}



As a longer example, consider a scenario where a node earlier in the workflow has the following output data:
1
 2
 3
 4
 5
 6
 7
 8
 9
10
11

  {

    "name": "Jay Gatsby",
  },
  {
    "id": "23423533",
    "name": "José Arcadio Buendía",
  },
  {
    "id": "23423534",

    "name": "Zaphod Beeblebrox",
  },
  {
    "id": "23423536",
    "name": "Edmund Pevensie",
  }
]



To extract the name, use the following expression:
1
{{$("<node-name>").item.json.name}}



Access the linked item in the current node's input#
In this case, the item linking is within the node: find the input item that the node links to an output item.
1
2
// Returns the linked item
{{$input.item}}



As a longer example, consider a scenario where the current node has the following input data:
1

    "name": "Zaphod Beeblebrox",
  },
  {
    "id": "23423536",
    "name": "Edmund Pevensie",
  }
]



To extract the name, you'd normally use drag-and-drop Data mapping, but you could also write the following expression:
1
{{$input.item.json.name}}

Data item linking#
An item is a single piece of data. Nodes receive one or more items, operate on them, and output new items. Each item links back to previous items.
You need to understand this behavior if you're:
Building a programmatic-style node that implements complex behaviors with its input and output data.
Using the Code node or expressions editor to access data from earlier items in the workflow.
Using the Code node for complex behaviors with input and output data.
This section provides:
A conceptual overview of Item linking concepts.
Information on Item linking for node creators.
Support for end users who need to Work with the data path to retrieve item data from previous nodes, and link items when using the Code node.
Guidance on troubleshooting Errors.
tem linking concepts#
Each output item created by a node includes metadata that links them to the input item (or items) that the node used to generate them. This creates a chain of items that you can work back along to access previous items. This can be complicated to understand, especially if the node splits or merges data. You need to understand item linking when building your own programmatic nodes, or in some scenarios using the Code node.
This document provides a conceptual overview of this feature. For usage details, refer to:
Item linking for node creators, for details on how to handle item linking when building a node.
Item linking in the Code node, to learn how to handle item linking in the Code node.
Item linking errors, to understand the errors you may encounter in the editor UI.
n8n's automatic item linking#
If a node doesn't control how to link input items to output items, n8n tries to guess how to link the items automatically:
Single input, single output: the output links to the input.
Single input, multiple outputs: all outputs link to that input.
Multiple inputs and outputs:
If you keep the input items, but change the order (or remove some but keep others), n8n can automatically add the correct linked item information.
If the number of inputs and outputs is equal, n8n links the items in order. This means that output-1 links to input-1, output-2 to input-2, and so on.
If the number isn't equal, or you create completely new items, n8n can't automatically link items.
If n8n can't link items automatically, and the node doesn't handle the item linking, n8n displays an error. Refer to Item linking errors for more information.
Item linking example#

In this example, it's possible for n8n to link an item in one node back several steps, despite the item order changing. This means the node that sorts movies alphabetically can access information about the linked item in the node that gets famous movie actors.
The methods for accessing linked items are different depending on whether you're using the UI, expressions, or the code node. Explore the following resources:
Mapping in the UI
Mapping in the expressions editor
Item linking in the Code node
Item linking errors
Item linking in the Code node#
Use n8n's item linking to access data from items that precede the current item. It also has implications when using the Code node. Most nodes link every output item to an input item. This creates a chain of items that you can work back along to access previous items. For a deeper conceptual overview of this topic, refer to Item linking concepts. This document focuses on practical usage examples.
When using the Code node, there are some scenarios where you need to manually supply item linking information if you want to be able to use $("<node-name>").item later in the workflow. All these scenarios only apply if you have more than one incoming item. n8n automatically handles item linking for single items.
These scenarios are when you:
Add new items: the new items aren't linked to any input.
Return new items.
Want to manually control the item linking.
n8n's automatic item linking handles the other scenarios.
To control item linking, set pairedItem when returning data. For example, to link to the item at index 0:
1
2
3
4
5
6
7
8
9
[
	{
		"json": {
			. . . 
		},
		// The index of the input item that generated this output item
		"pairedItem": 0
	}
]



pairedItem usage example#
Take this input data:
1
 2
 3
 4
 5
 6
 7
 8
 9
10
11
12
13
14

  {
    "id": "23423532",
    "name": "Jay Gatsby"
  },
  {
    "id": "23423533",
    "name": "José Arcadio Buendía"
  },
  {
    "id": "23423534",
    "name": "Max Sendak"
  },
  {
    "id": "23423535",
    "name": "Zaphod Beeblebrox"
  },
  {
    "id": "23423536",
    "name": "Edmund Pevensie"
  }
]



And use it to generate new items, containing just the name, along with a new piece of data:
1
 2
 3
 4
 5
 6
 7
 8
 9
10
11
12
13
14
newItems = [];
for(let i=0; i<items.length; i++){
  newItems.push(
    {
    "json":
      {
        "name": items[i].json.name,
				"aBrandNewField": "New data for item " + i
      }
    }
  )
}

return newItems;



newItems is an array of items with no pairedItem. This means there's no way to trace back from these items to the items used to generate them.
Add the pairedItem object:
1
 2
 3
 4
 5
 6
 7
 8
 9
10
11
12
13
14
newItems = [];
for(let i=0; i<items.length; i++){
  newItems.push(
    {
      "json":
        {
          "name": items[i].json.name,
					"aBrandNewField": "New data for item " + i
        },
      "pairedItem": i
    }    
  )
}
return newItems;



Each new item now links to the item used to create it.
Item linking errors#
In n8n you can reference data from any previous node. This doesn't have to be the node just before: it can be any previous node in the chain. When referencing nodes further back, you use the expression syntax $(node_name).item.

Diagram of threads for different items. Due to the item linking, you can get the actor for each movie using $('Get famous movie actors').item.
Since the previous node can have multiple items in it, n8n needs to know which one to use. When using .item, n8n figures this out for you behind the scenes. Refer to Item linking concepts for detailed information on how this works.
.item fails if information is missing. To figure out which item to use, n8n maintains a thread back through the workflow's nodes for each item. For a given item, this thread tells n8n which items in previous nodes generated it. To find the matching item in a given previous node, n8n follows this thread back until it reaches the node in question.
When using .item, n8n displays an error when:
The thread is broken
The thread points to more than one item in the previous node (as it's unclear which one to use)
To solve these errors, you can either avoid using .item, or fix the root cause.
You can avoid .item by using .first(), .last() or .all()[index] instead. They require you to know the position of the item that you’re targeting within the target node's output items. Refer to Built in methods and variables | Output of other nodes for more detail on these methods.
The fix for the root cause depends on the exact error.
Fix for 'Info for expressions missing from previous node'#
If you see this error message:
ERROR: Info for expression missing from previous node
There's a node in the chain that doesn't return pairing information. The solution here depends on the type of the previous node:
Code nodes: make sure you return which input items the node used to produce each output item. Refer to Item linking in the code node for more information.
Custom or community nodes: the node creator needs to update the node to return which input items it uses to produce each output item. Refer to Item linking for node creators for more information.
Fix for 'Multiple matching items for expression'#
This is the error message:
ERROR: Multiple matching items for expression
Sometimes n8n uses multiple items to create a single item. Examples include the Summarize, Aggregate, and Merge nodes. These nodes can combine information from multiple items.
When you use .item and there are multiple possible matches, n8n doesn't know which one to use. To solve this you can either:
Use .first(), .last() or .all()[index] instead. Refer to Built in methods and variables | Output of other nodes for more detail on these methods.
Reference a different node that contains the same information, but doesn't have multiple matching items.
Item linking for node creators#
Programmatic-style nodes only
This guidance applies to programmatic-style nodes. If you're using declarative style, n8n handles paired items for you automatically.
Use n8n's item linking to access data from items that precede the current item. n8n needs to know which input item a given output item comes from. If this information is missing, expressions in other nodes may break. As a node developer, you must ensure any items returned by your node support this.
This applies to programmatic nodes (including trigger nodes). You don't need to consider item linking when building a declarative-style node. Refer to Choose your node building approach for more information on node styles.
Start by reading Item linking concepts, which provides a conceptual overview of item linking, and details of the scenarios where n8n can handle the linking automatically.
If you need to handle item linking manually, do this by setting pairedItem on each item your node returns:
1
 2
 3

// Use the pairedItem information of the incoming item
newItem = {
	"json": { . . . },
	"pairedItem": {
		"item": item.pairedItem,
		// Optional: choose the input to use
		// Set this if your node combines multiple inputs
		"input": 0
};

// Or set the index manually
newItem = {
		"json": { . . . }
		"pairedItem": {
			"item": i,
			// Optional: choose the input to use
			// Set this if your node combines multiple inputs
			"input": 0
		},
};

Data pinning#
You can 'pin' data during workflow development. Data pinning means saving the output data of a node, and using the saved data instead of fetching fresh data in future workflow executions.
You can use this when working with data from external sources to avoid having to repeat requests to the external system. This can save time and resources:
If your workflow relies on an external system to trigger it, such as a webhook call, being able to pin data means you don't need to use the external system every time you test the workflow.
If the external resource has data or usage limits, pinning data during tests avoids consuming your resource limits.
You can fetch and pin the data you want to test, then have confidence that the data is consistent in all your workflow tests.
You can only pin data for nodes that have a single main output ("error" outputs don't count for this purpose).
For development only
Data pinning isn't available for production workflow executions. It's a feature to help test workflows during development.
Pin data#
To pin data in a node:
Run the node to load data.
In the OUTPUT view, select Pin data . When data pinning is active, the button is disabled and a "This data is pinned" banner is displayed in the OUTPUT view.
Nodes that output binary data
You can't pin data if the output data includes binary data.
Unpin data#
When data pinning is active, a banner appears at the top of the node's output panel indicating that n8n has pinned the data. To unpin data and fetch fresh data on the next execution, select the Unpin link in the banner.
Data editing#
n8n allows you to edit pinned data. This means you can check different scenarios without setting up each scenario and sending the relevant data from your external system. It makes it easier to test edge cases.
For development only
Data editing isn't available for production workflow executions. It's a feature to help test workflows during development.
Edit output data#
To edit output data:
Run the node to load data.
In the OUTPUT view, select JSON to switch to JSON view.
Select Edit .
Edit your data.
Select Save. n8n saves your data changes and pins your data.
Use data from previous executions#
You can copy data from nodes in previous workflow executions:
Open the left menu.
Select Executions.
Browse the workflow executions list to find the one with the data you want to copy.
Select Open Past Execution .
Double click the node whose data you want to copy.
If it's table layout, select JSON to switch to JSON view.
There are two ways to copy the JSON:
Select the JSON you want by highlighting it, like selecting text. Then use ctrl + c to copy it.
Select the JSON you want to copy by clicking on a parameter. Then:
Hover over the JSON. n8n displays the Copy  button.
Select Copy .
You can choose what to copy:
Copy Item Path and Copy Parameter Path gives you expressions that access parts of the JSON.
Copy Value: copies the entire selected JSON.
Return to the workflow you're working on:
Open the left menu.
Select Workflows.
Select Open.
Select the workflow you want to open.
Open the node where you want to use the copied data.
If there is no data, run the node to load data.
In the OUTPUT view, select JSON to switch to JSON view.
Select Edit .
Paste in the data from the previous execution.
Select Save. n8n saves your data changes and pins your data.
Data filtering#
Feature availability
Available on Cloud Pro and Enterprise plans.
Search and filter data in the node INPUT and OUTPUT panels. Use this to check your node's data.
To search:
In a node, select Search  in the INPUT or OUTPUT panel.
Enter your search term.
n8n filters as you type your search, displaying the objects or rows containing the term.
Filtering is purely visual: n8n doesn't change or delete data. The filter resets when you close and reopen the node.
Data mocking#
Data mocking is simulating or faking data. It's useful when developing a workflow. By mocking data, you can:
Avoid making repeated calls to your data source. This saves time and costs.
Work with a small, predictable dataset during initial development.
Avoid the risk of overwriting live data: in the early stages of building your workflow, you don't need to connect your real data source.
Mocking with real data using data pinning#
Using data pinning, you load real data into your workflow, then pin it in the output panel of a node. Using this approach you have realistic data, with only one call to your data source. You can edit pinned data.
Use this approach when you need to configure your workflow to handle the exact data structure and parameters provided by your data source.
To pin data in a node:
Run the node to load data.
In the OUTPUT view, select Pin data . When data pinning is active, the button is disabled and a "This data is pinned" banner is displayed in the OUTPUT view.
Nodes that output binary data
You can't pin data if the output data includes binary data.
Generate custom data using the Code or Edit Fields nodes#
You can create a custom dataset in your workflow using either the Code node or the Edit Fields (Set) node.
In the Code node, you can create any data set you want, and return it as the node output. In the Edit Fields node, select Add fields to add your custom data.
The Edit Fields node is a good choice for small tests. To create more complex datasets, use the Code node.
Output a sample data set from the Customer Datastore node#
The Customer Datastore node provides a fake dataset to work with. Add and execute the node to explore the data.
Use this approach if you need some test data when exploring n8n, and you don't have a real use-case to work with.
Binary data#
Binary data is any file-type data, such as image files or documents.
This page collects resources relating to binary data in n8n.
Working with binary data in your workflows#
You can process binary data in n8n workflows. n8n provides nodes to help you work with binary data. You can also use code.
Nodes#
There are three key nodes dedicated to handling binary data files:
Read/Write Files from Disk to read and write files from/to the machine where n8n is running.
Convert to File to take input data and output it as a file.
Extract From File to get data from a binary format and convert it to JSON.
There are separate nodes for working with XML and HTML data:
HTML
XML
And nodes for performing common tasks:
Compression
Edit Image
FTP
You can trigger a workflow based on changes to a local file using the Local File trigger.
To split or concatenate binary data items, use the data transformation nodes.
Code#
You can use the Code node to manipulate binary data in your workflows. For example, Get the binary data buffer: get the binary data available in your workflow.
Configure binary data mode when self-hosting#
You can configure how your self-hosted n8n instance handles binary data using the Binary data environment variables. This includes tasks such as setting the storage path and choosing how to store binary data.
Your configuration affects how well n8n scales: Scaling | Binary data filesystem mode.
Reading and writing binary files can have security implications. If you want to disable reading and writing binary data, use the NODES_EXCLUDE environment variable. Refer to Environment variables | Nodes for more information.
Schema Preview#
Schema Preview exposes expected schema data from the previous node in the Node Editor without the user having to provide credentials or execute the node. This makes it possible to construct workflows without having to provide credentials in advance. The preview doesn't include mock data, but it does expose the expected fields, making it possible to select and incorporate them into the input of subsequent nodes.
Using the preview#
There must be a node with Schema Preview available in your workflow.
When clicking on the details of the next node in the sequence, the Schema Preview data will show up in the Node Editor where schema data would typically be exposed.
Use data from the Schema Preview just as you would other schemas - drag and drop fields as input into your node parameters and settings.
Glossary
AI agent#
AI agents are artificial intelligence systems capable of responding to requests, making decisions, and performing real-world tasks for users. They use large language models (LLMs) to interpret user input and make decisions about how to best process requests using the information and resources they have available.
AI chain#
AI chains allow you to interact with large language models (LLMs) and other resources in sequences of calls to components. AI chains in n8n don't use persistent memory, so you can't use them to reference previous context (use AI agents for this).
AI embedding#
Embeddings are numerical representations of data using vectors. They're used by AI to interpret complex data and relationships by mapping values across many dimensions. Vector databases, or vector stores, are databases designed to store and access embeddings.
AI groundedness#
In AI, and specifically in retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) contexts, groundedness and ungroundedness are measures of how much a model's responses accurately reflect source information. The model uses its source documents to generate grounded responses, while ungrounded responses involve speculation or hallucination unsupported by those same sources.
AI reranking#
Reranking is a technique that refines the order of a list of candidate documents to improve the relevance of search results. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and other applications use reranking to prioritize the most relevant information for generation or downstream tasks.
AI memory#
In an AI context, memory allows AI tools to persist message context across interactions. This allows you to have a continuing conversations with AI agents, for example, without submitting ongoing context with each message. In n8n, AI agent nodes can use memory, but AI chains can't.
AI retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)#
Retrieval-augmented generation, or RAG, is a technique for providing LLMs access to new information from external sources to improve AI responses. RAG systems retrieve relevant documents to ground responses in up-to-date, domain-specific, or proprietary knowledge to supplement their original training data. RAG systems often rely on vector stores to manage and search this external data efficiently.
AI tool#
In an AI context, a tool is an add-on resource that the AI can refer to for specific information or functionality when responding to a request. The AI model can use a tool to interact with external systems or complete specific, focused tasks.
AI vector store#
Vector stores, or vector databases, are databases designed to store numerical representations of information called embeddings.
API#
APIs, or application programming interfaces, offer programmatic access to a service's data and functionality. APIs make it easier for software to interact with external systems. They're often offered as an alternative to traditional user-focused interfaces accessed through web browsers or UI.
canvas (n8n)#
The canvas is the main interface for building workflows in n8n's editor UI. You use the canvas to add and connect nodes to compose workflows.
cluster node (n8n)#
In n8n, cluster nodes are groups of nodes that work together to provide functionality in a workflow. They consist of a root node and one or more sub nodes that extend the node's functionality.
credential (n8n)#
In n8n, credentials store authentication information to connect with specific apps and services. After creating credentials with your authentication information (username and password, API key, OAuth secrets, etc.), you can use the associated app node to interact with the service.
data pinning (n8n)#
Data pinning allows you to temporarily freeze the output data of a node during workflow development. This allows you to develop workflows with predictable data without making repeated requests to external services. Production workflows ignore pinned data and request new data on each execution.
editor (n8n)#
The n8n editor UI allows you to create and manage workflows. The main area is the canvas, where you can compose workflows by adding, configuring, and connecting nodes. The side and top panels allow you to access other areas of the UI like credentials, templates, variables, executions, and more.
entitlement (n8n)#
In n8n, entitlements grant n8n instances access to plan-restricted features for a specific period of time.
Floating entitlements are a pool of entitlements that you can distribute among various n8n instances. You can re-assign a floating entitlement to transfer its access to a different n8n instance.
evaluation (n8n)#
In n8n, evaluation allows you to tag and organize execution history and compare it against new executions. You can use this to understand how your workflow performs over time as you make changes. In particular, this is useful while developing AI-centered workflows.
expression (n8n)#
In n8n, expressions allow you to populate node parameters dynamically by executing JavaScript code. Instead of providing a static value, you can use the n8n expression syntax to define the value using data from previous nodes, other workflows, or your n8n environment.
LangChain#
LangChain is an AI-development framework used to work with large language models (LLMs). LangChain provides a standardized system for working with a wide variety of models and other resources and linking different components together to build complex applications.
Large language model (LLM)#
Large language models, or LLMs, are AI machine learning models designed to excel in natural language processing (NLP) tasks. They're built by training on large amounts of data to develop probabilistic models of language and other data.
node (n8n)#
In n8n, nodes are individual components that you compose to create workflows. Nodes define when the workflow should run, allow you to fetch, send, and process data, can define flow control logic, and connect with external services.
project (n8n)#
n8n projects allow you to separate workflows, variables, and credentials into separate groups for easier management. Projects make it easier for teams to collaborate by sharing and compartmentalizing related resources.
root node (n8n)#
Each n8n cluster node contains a single root nodes that defines the main functionality of the cluster. One or more sub nodes attach to the root node to extend its functionality.
sub node (n8n)#
n8n cluster nodes consist of one or more sub nodes connected to a root node. Sub nodes extend the functionality of the root node, providing access to specific services or resources or offering specific types of dedicated processing, like calculator functionality, for example.
template (n8n)#
n8n templates are pre-built workflows designed by n8n and community members that you can import into your n8n instance. When using templates, you may need to fill in credentials and adjust the configuration to suit your needs.
trigger node (n8n)#
A trigger node is a special node responsible for executing the workflow in response to certain conditions. All production workflows need at least one trigger to determine when the workflow should run.
workflow (n8n)#
An n8n workflow is a collection of nodes that automate a process. Workflows begin execution when a trigger condition occurs and execute sequentially to achieve complex tasks.
